## abstracts:
Mental stress is a prevalent condition that can have negative impacts on one's health. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing related illnesses and maintaining overall wellness. This study presents a new method for identifying mental stress using a wearable biosensor worn in the ear. Data was gathered from 14 participants in a controlled environment using stress-inducing tasks such as memory and math tests. The raw photoplethysmography data was then processed by filtering, segmenting, and transforming it into scalograms using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) which are based on two different mother wavelets, namely, a generalized Morse wavelet and the analytic Morlet (Gabor) wavelet. The scalograms were then passed through a convolutional neural network classifier, GoogLeNet, to classify the signals as stressed or non-stressed. The method achieved an outstanding result using the generalized Morse wavelet with an accuracy of 91.02% and an F1-score of 90.95%. This method demonstrates promise as a reliable tool for early detection and treatment of mental stress by providing real-time monitoring and allowing for preventive measures to be taken before it becomes a serious issue.
