## abstracts:
Generating continuous electroencephalography (EEG) signals through advanced artificial neural networks presents a novel opportunity to enhance brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. This capability has the potential to significantly enhance applications ranging from simulating dynamic brain activity and data augmentation to improving real-time epilepsy detection and BCI inference. By harnessing generative transformer neural networks, specifically designed for EEG signal generation, we can revolutionize the interpretation and interaction with neural data. Generative AI has demonstrated significant success across various domains, from natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to content creation in visual arts and music. It distinguishes itself by using large-scale datasets to construct context windows during pre-training, a technique that has proven particularly effective in NLP, where models are fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks after extensive foundational training. However, the application of generative AI in the field of BCIs, particularly through the development of continuous, context-rich neural signal generators, has been limited. To address this, we introduce the Generative EEG Transformer (GET), a model leveraging transformer architecture tailored for EEG data. The GET model is pre-trained on diverse EEG datasets, including motor imagery and alpha wave datasets, enabling it to produce high-fidelity neural signals that maintain contextual integrity. Our empirical findings indicate that GET not only faithfully reproduces the frequency spectrum of the training data and input prompts but also robustly generates continuous neural signals. By adopting the successful training strategies of the NLP domain for BCIs, the GET sets a new standard for the development and application of neural signal generation technologies.
