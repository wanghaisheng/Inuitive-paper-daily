## abstracts:
MicroMagnetic.jl is an open-source Julia package for micromagnetic and atomistic simulations. Using the features of the Julia programming language, MicroMagnetic.jl supports CPU and various GPU platforms, including NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple GPUs. Moreover, MicroMagnetic.jl supports Monte Carlo simulations for atomistic models and implements the Nudged-Elastic-Band method for energy barrier computations. With built-in support for double and single precision modes and a design allowing easy extensibility to add new features, MicroMagnetic.jl provides a versatile toolset for researchers in micromagnetics and atomistic simulations.
## QA:
coming soon
