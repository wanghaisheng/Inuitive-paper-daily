## abstracts:
Navigating through a physical environment to reach a desired location involves a complex interplay of cognitive, sensory, and motor functions. When navigating with others, experiencing a degree of behavioral and cognitive synchronization is both natural and ubiquitous. This synchronization facilitates a harmonious effort toward achieving a common goal, reflecting how individuals instinctively align their actions and thoughts in collaborative settings. Collaborative spatial tasks, which are crucial in daily and professional settings, require coordinated navigation and problem-solving skills. This study explores the neural mechanisms underlying such tasks by using hyperscanning electroencephalography (EEG) technology to examine brain dynamics in dyadic route planning within a virtual reality setting. By analyzing intra- and inter-brain couplings across delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma EEG bands using both functional and effective connectivity measures, we identified significant neural synchronization patterns associated with collaborative task performance in both leaders and followers. Functional intra-brain connectivity analyses revealed distinct neural engagement across EEG frequency bands, with increased delta couplings observed in both leaders and followers. Theta connectivity was particularly enhanced in followers, whereas the alpha band exhibited divergent patterns that indicate role-specific neural strategies. Inter-brain analysis revealed increased delta causality between interacting members but decreased theta and gamma couplings from followers to leaders. Additionally, inter-brain analysis indicated decreased couplings in faster-performing dyads, especially in theta bands. These insights enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms driving collaborative spatial navigation and demonstrate the effectiveness of hyperscanning in studying complex brain-to-brain interactions.
