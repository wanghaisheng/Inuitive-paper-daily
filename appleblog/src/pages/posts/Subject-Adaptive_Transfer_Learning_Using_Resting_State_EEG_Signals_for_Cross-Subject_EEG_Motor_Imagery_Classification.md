## abstracts:
Electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery (MI) classification is a fundamental, yet challenging task due to the variation of signals between individuals i.e., inter-subject variability. Previous approaches try to mitigate this using task-specific (TS) EEG signals from the target subject in training. However, recording TS EEG signals requires time and limits its applicability in various fields. In contrast, resting state (RS) EEG signals are a viable alternative due to ease of acquisition with rich subject information. In this paper, we propose a novel subject-adaptive transfer learning strategy that utilizes RS EEG signals to adapt models on unseen subject data. Specifically, we disentangle extracted features into task- and subject-dependent features and use them to calibrate RS EEG signals for obtaining task information while preserving subject characteristics. The calibrated signals are then used to adapt the model to the target subject, enabling the model to simulate processing TS EEG signals of the target subject. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three public benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in cross-subject EEG MI classification. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging RS EEG signals to advance practical brain-computer interface systems.
