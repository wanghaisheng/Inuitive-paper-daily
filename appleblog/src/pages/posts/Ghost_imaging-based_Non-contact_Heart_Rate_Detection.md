## abstracts:
Remote heart rate measurement is an increasingly concerned research field, usually using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) to collect heart rate information through video data collection. However, in certain specific scenarios (such as low light conditions, intense lighting, and non-line-of-sight situations), traditional imaging methods fail to capture image information effectively, that may lead to difficulty or inability in measuring heart rate. To address these limitations, this study proposes using ghost imaging as a substitute for traditional imaging in the aforementioned scenarios. The mean absolute error between experimental measurements and reference true values is 4.24 bpm.Additionally, the bucket signals obtained by the ghost imaging system can be directly processed using digital signal processing techniques, thereby enhancing personal privacy protection.
## QA:
coming soon
