## abstracts:
Actigraphy has been widely used for the analysis of circadian rhythm. Current practice applies regression analysis to data from multiple days to estimate the circadian phase. This paper presents a filtering method for online processing of biometric data to estimate the circadian phase. We apply the proposed method on actigraphy data of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster).
## QA:
coming soon
