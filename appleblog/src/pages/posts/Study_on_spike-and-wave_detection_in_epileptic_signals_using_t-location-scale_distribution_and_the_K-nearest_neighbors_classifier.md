## abstracts:
Pattern classification in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an important problem in biomedical engineering since it enables the detection of brain activity, particularly the early detection of epileptic seizures. In this paper, we propose a k-nearest neighbors classification for epileptic EEG signals based on a t-location-scale statistical representation to detect spike-and-waves. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a real dataset containing both spike-and-wave events and normal brain function signals, where our performance is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
## QA:
coming soon
