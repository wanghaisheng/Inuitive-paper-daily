## abstracts:
We show that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the paramagnetic response of itinerant electrons in proximitized superconductor/paramagnet systems gives rise to the inverse spin galvanic effect, i.e. generation of magnetic moment under the influence of the charge current. Depending on the sign of the SOC constant and the system temperature, the corresponding contribution to the magnetic response of the superconductor can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic. We discuss the relevance between the discovered phenomena and the recent experiments on Pt/Nb heterostructures as well as the puzzling sign change of the magnetic response observed in clean Ag coated Nb cylinders.
## QA:
