## abstracts:
The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in agriculture holds promise for transforming farming practices, particularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This study explores the adoption of smart farming practices among KSA farmers. Due to the geographical location and nature of KSA, it faces significant challenges in agriculture. The objective of this research is to discuss how IoT will enhance agriculture in KSA and identify its current usage by conducting a study on Saudi farmers with varying ages, regions, and years of experience. The results indicate that 90% of the farmers encounter challenges in farming, and all of them express interest in adopting smart farming to address these issues. While 60% of farmers are currently utilizing IoT technologies, they encounter challenges in implementing smart farming practices. Thus, smart farming presents solutions to prevalent challenges including adverse weather, water scarcity, and labor shortages, though barriers include cost and educational challenges.
