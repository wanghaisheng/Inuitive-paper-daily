## abstracts:
Phosphorene, a well-studied 2D allotrope of phosphorus, features unique properties such as widely tunable bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable intrinsic in-plane anisotropy. Utilizing these structural and electronic properties, we investigate ultrafast electron dynamics and high harmonic generation (HHG) from phosphorene subject to band structure engineering through external strain, based on ab initio time-dependent density-functional theory approach. We show that strong field processes in such systems can be optimized and controlled by biaxial tensile and compressive strain engineering, that results in electronic structure modification. While -10% strain resulted in closing of band gap, 2% strain increased the gap by 22% with respect to 0.9 eV in pristine phosphorene, consequently affecting the high harmonic yield. With reduction of gap, by applying strain from 2% to -10%, the valence band near $\Gamma-$point becomes more flat and discreet, resulting in large electronic density of states and enhanced electronic excitation, which reflects in their ultrafast sub-cycle dynamics under laser excitation. Moreover, due to its intrinsic in-plane anisotropy, harmonic yield with laser polarization along the armchair (AC) direction is found to be higher than that of the zigzag (ZZ) direction for all the strain cases. Nearly, an order of magnitude enhancement of harmonic intensity is achieved for -10% strain along AC direction. The current study expands the research possibilities of phosphorene into a previously unexplored domain, indicating its potential for future utilization in extreme-ultraviolet and attosecond nanophotonics, and also for efficient table-top HHG sources.
