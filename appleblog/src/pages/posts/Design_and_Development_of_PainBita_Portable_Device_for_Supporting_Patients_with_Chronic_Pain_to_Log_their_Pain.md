## abstracts:
Recently, we have seen growing interest among patients with chronic conditions to track their health-related data. There are many wearable devices available to track different health data. However, tracking pain is mostly done by using pen and paper or mobile apps. In collaboration with a healthcare professional we designed a portable pain tracker, PainBit. To gain an understanding of patients' perspectives on our tracker, we conducted two case studies with patients living with chronic pain. We asked patients to use PainBit for two weeks and later conducted semi-structured interviews with them. Patients found PainBit useful for tracking their pain and they preferred using a physical device, PainBit, to track their pain over using a mobile phone. Patients suggested reducing the size and weight of PainBit in the next iterations. We report on the lessons learnt through our design process and the evaluation studies.
## QA:
