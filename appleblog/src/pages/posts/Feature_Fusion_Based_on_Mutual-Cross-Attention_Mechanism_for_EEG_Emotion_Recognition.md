## abstracts:
An objective and accurate emotion diagnostic reference is vital to psychologists, especially when dealing with patients who are difficult to communicate with for pathological reasons. Nevertheless, current systems based on Electroencephalography (EEG) data utilized for sentiment discrimination have some problems, including excessive model complexity, mediocre accuracy, and limited interpretability. Consequently, we propose a novel and effective feature fusion mechanism named Mutual-Cross-Attention (MCA). Combining with a specially customized 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN), this purely mathematical mechanism adeptly discovers the complementary relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain features in EEG data. Furthermore, the new designed Channel-PSD-DE 3D feature also contributes to the high performance. The proposed method eventually achieves 99.49% (valence) and 99.30% (arousal) accuracy on DEAP dataset.
