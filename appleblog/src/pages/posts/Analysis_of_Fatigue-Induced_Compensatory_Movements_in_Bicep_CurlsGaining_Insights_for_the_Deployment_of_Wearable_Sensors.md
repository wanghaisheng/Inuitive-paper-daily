## abstracts:
A common challenge in Bicep Curls rehabilitation is muscle compensation, where patients adopt alternative movement patterns when the primary muscle group cannot act due to injury or fatigue, significantly decreasing the effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts. The problem is exacerbated by the growing trend toward transitioning from in-clinic to home-based rehabilitation, where constant monitoring and correction by physiotherapists are limited. Developing wearable sensors capable of detecting muscle compensation becomes crucial to address this challenge. This study aims to gain insights into the optimal deployment of wearable sensors through a comprehensive study of muscle compensation in Bicep Curls. We collect upper limb joint kinematics and surface electromyography signals (sEMG) from eight muscles in 12 healthy subjects during standard and fatigue stages. Two muscle synergies are derived from sEMG signals and are analyzed comprehensively along with joint kinematics. Our findings reveal a shift in the relative contribution of forearm muscles to shoulder muscles, accompanied by a significant increase in activation amplitude for both synergies. Additionally, more pronounced movement was observed at the shoulder joint during fatigue. These results suggest focusing on the shoulder muscle activities and joint motions when deploying wearable sensors to effectively detect compensatory movements.
