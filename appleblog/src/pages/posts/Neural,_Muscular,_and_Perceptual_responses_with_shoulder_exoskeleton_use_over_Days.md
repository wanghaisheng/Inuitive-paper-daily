## abstracts:
Passive shoulder exoskeletons have been widely introduced in the industry to aid upper extremity movements during repetitive overhead work. As an ergonomic intervention, it is important to understand how users adapt to these devices over time and if these induce external stress while working. The study evaluated the use of an exoskeleton over a period of 3 days by assessing the neural, physiological, and perceptual responses of twenty-four participants by comparing a physical task against the same task with an additional cognitive workload. Over days adaptation to task irrespective of task and group were identified. Electromyography (EMG) analysis of shoulder and back muscles reveals lower muscle activity in the exoskeleton group irrespective of task. Functional connectivity analysis using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) reveals that exoskeletons benefit users by reducing task demands in the motor planning and execution regions. Sex-based differences were also identified in these neuromuscular assessments.
