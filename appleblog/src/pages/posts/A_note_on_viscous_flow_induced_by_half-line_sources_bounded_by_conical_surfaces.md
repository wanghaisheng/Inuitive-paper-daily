## abstracts:
In this paper axisymmetric solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations governing the flow induced by a half-line source when the fluid domain is bounded by a conical wall are discussed. Two types of boundary conditions are identified; one in which the radial velocity along the axis is prescribed, and the other in which the radial velocity along the axis is obtained as an eigenvalue of the problem. The existence of these solutions are limited to a range of Reynolds numbers and the transition from one case to the other are discussed in detail.
## QA:
coming soon
