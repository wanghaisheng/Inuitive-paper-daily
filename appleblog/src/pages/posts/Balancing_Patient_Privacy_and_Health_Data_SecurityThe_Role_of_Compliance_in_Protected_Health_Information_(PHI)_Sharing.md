## abstracts:
Protected Health Information (PHI) sharing significantly enhances patient care quality and coordination, contributing to more accurate diagnoses, efficient treatment plans, and a comprehensive understanding of patient history. Compliance with strict privacy and security policies, such as those required by laws like HIPAA, is critical to protect PHI. Blockchain technology, which offers a decentralized and tamper-evident ledger system, hold promise in policy compliance. This system ensures the authenticity and integrity of PHI while facilitating patient consent management. In this work, we propose a blockchain technology that integrates smart contracts to partially automate consent-related processes and ensuring that PHI access and sharing follow patient preferences and legal requirements.
## QA:
