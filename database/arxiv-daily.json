Smart watches and phones, fitness trackers or smart textiles now provide unprecedented access to our own personal data. As such, wearable devices can enable health monitoring without disrupting our daily routines. In clinical settings, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and photoplethysmographies (PPGs) are used to monitor the heart's and respiratory behaviors. In more practical settings, accelerometers can be used to estimate the heartrate when they are attached to the chest. They can also help filter out some noise in ECG signal from movement. In this work, we compare the heart rate data extracted from the built-in accelerometer of a commercial smart pen equipped with sensors (STABILO's DigiPen), with a standard ECG monitor readouts. We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict the heart rate from the smart pencil. The data collection is done with eight volunteers, writing the alphabet continuously for five minutes. The signal is processed with a Butterworth filter to cut off noise. We achieve a mean-squared error (MSE) better than 6.685x10$^{-3}$ comparing the DigiPen's computed ${\\Delta}$t (time between pulses) with the reference ECG data. The peaks' timestamps for both signals all maintain a correlation higher than 0.99. All computed heart rates from the pen accurately correlate with the reference ECG signals.|\n", "2308.08556": "|**2023-08-11**|**Causally Linking Health Application Data and Personal Information Management Tools**|Saturnino Luz et.al.|[2308.08556v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08556v1)|null|The proliferation of consumer health devices such as smart watches, sleep monitors, smart scales, etc, in many countries, has not only led to growing interest in health monitoring, but also to the development of a countless number of ``smart'' applications to support the exploration of such data by members of the general public, sometimes with integration into professional health services. While a variety of health data streams has been made available by such devices to users, these streams are often presented as separate time-series visualizations, in which the potential relationships between health variables are not explicitly made visible. Furthermore, despite the fact that other aspects of life, such as work and social connectivity, have become increasingly digitised, health and well-being applications make little use of the potentially useful contextual information provided by widely used personal information management tools, such as shared calendar and email systems. This paper presents a framework for the integration of these diverse data sources, analytic and visualization tools, with inference methods and graphical user interfaces to help users by highlighting causal connections among such time-series.|\n", "2307.05339": "|**2023-07-07**|**A Self-Supervised Algorithm for Denoising Photoplethysmography Signals for Heart Rate Estimation from Wearables**|Pranay Jain et.al.|[2307.05339v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05339v1)|null|Smart watches and other wearable devices are equipped with photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors for monitoring heart rate and other aspects of cardiovascular health. However, PPG signals collected from such devices are susceptible to corruption from noise and motion artifacts, which cause errors in heart rate estimation. Typical denoising approaches filter or reconstruct the signal in ways that eliminate much of the morphological information, even from the clean parts of the signal that would be useful to preserve. In this work, we develop an algorithm for denoising PPG signals that reconstructs the corrupted parts of the signal, while preserving the clean parts of the PPG signal. Our novel framework relies on self-supervised training, where we leverage a large database of clean PPG signals to train a denoising autoencoder. As we show, our reconstructed signals provide better estimates of heart rate from PPG signals than the leading heart rate estimation methods. Further experiments show significant improvement in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) estimation from PPG signals using our algorithm. We conclude that our algorithm denoises PPG signals in a way that can improve downstream analysis of many different health metrics from wearable devices.|\n", "2305.19541": "|**2023-05-31**|**Few-Shot Speaker Identification Using Lightweight Prototypical Network with Feature Grouping and Interaction**|Yanxiong Li et.al.|[2305.19541v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19541v1)|null|Existing methods for few-shot speaker identification (FSSI) obtain high accuracy, but their computational complexities and model sizes need to be reduced for lightweight applications. In this work, we propose a FSSI method using a lightweight prototypical network with the final goal to implement the FSSI on intelligent terminals with limited resources, such as smart watches and smart speakers. In the proposed prototypical network, an embedding module is designed to perform feature grouping for reducing the memory requirement and computational complexity, and feature interaction for enhancing the representational ability of the learned speaker embedding. In the proposed embedding module, audio feature of each speech sample is split into several low-dimensional feature subsets that are transformed by a recurrent convolutional block in parallel. Then, the operations of averaging, addition, concatenation, element-wise summation and statistics pooling are sequentially executed to learn a speaker embedding for each speech sample. The recurrent convolutional block consists of a block of bidirectional long short-term memory, and a block of de-redundancy convolution in which feature grouping and interaction are conducted too. Our method is compared to baseline methods on three datasets that are selected from three public speech corpora (VoxCeleb1, VoxCeleb2, and LibriSpeech). The results show that our method obtains higher accuracy under several conditions, and has advantages over all baseline methods in computational complexity and model size.|\n", "2302.13011": "|**2023-02-25**|**Myocardial Infarction Detection from ECG: A Gramian Angular Field-based 2D-CNN Approach**|Asim Yousuf et.al.|[2302.13011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13011v1)|null|This paper presents a novel method for myocardial infarction (MI) detection using lead II of electrocardiogram (ECG). Under our proposed method, we first clean the noisy ECG signals using db4 wavelet, followed by an R-peak detection algorithm to segment the ECG signals into beats. We then translate the ECG timeseries dataset to an equivalent dataset of gray-scale images using Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) and Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) operations. Subsequently, the gray-scale images are fed into a custom two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) which efficiently differentiates the ECG beats of the healthy subjects from the ECG beats of the subjects with MI. We train and test the performance of our proposed method on a public dataset, namely, Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) ECG dataset from Physionet. Our proposed approach achieves an average classification accuracy of 99.68\\%, 99.80\\%, 99.82\\%, and 99.84\\% under GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, and GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, respectively. Our proposed method is able to cope with additive noise and baseline wander, and does not require handcrafted features by a domain expert. Most importantly, this work opens the floor for innovation in wearable devices (e.g., smart watches, wrist bands etc.) to do accurate, real-time and early MI detection using a single-lead (lead II) ECG.|\n", "2210.01459": "|**2022-10-04**|**Learning from the Best: Contrastive Representations Learning Across Sensor Locations for Wearable Activity Recognition**|Vitor Fortes Rey et.al.|[2210.01459v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01459v1)|null|We address the well-known wearable activity recognition problem of having to work with sensors that are non-optimal in terms of information they provide but have to be used due to wearability/usability concerns (e.g. the need to work with wrist-worn IMUs because they are embedded in most smart watches). To mitigate this problem we propose a method that facilitates the use of information from sensors that are only present during the training process and are unavailable during the later use of the system. The method transfers information from the source sensors to the latent representation of the target sensor data through contrastive loss that is combined with the classification loss during joint training. We evaluate the method on the well-known PAMAP2 and Opportunity benchmarks for different combinations of source and target sensors showing average (over all activities) F1 score improvements of between 5% and 13% with the improvement on individual activities, particularly well suited to benefit from the additional information going up to between 20% and 40%.|\n", "2208.10569": "|**2022-08-22**|**Underwater Messaging Using Mobile Devices**|Tuochao Chen et.al.|[2208.10569v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10569v1)|null|Since its inception, underwater digital acoustic communication has required custom hardware that neither has the economies of scale nor is pervasive. We present the first acoustic system that brings underwater messaging capabilities to existing mobile devices like smartphones and smart watches. Our software-only solution leverages audio sensors, i.e., microphones and speakers, ubiquitous in today's devices to enable acoustic underwater communication between mobile devices. To achieve this, we design a communication system that in real-time adapts to differences in frequency responses across mobile devices, changes in multipath and noise levels at different locations and dynamic channel changes due to mobility. We evaluate our system in six different real-world underwater environments with depths of 2-15 m in the presence of boats, ships and people fishing and kayaking. Our results show that our system can in real-time adapt its frequency band and achieve bit rates of 100 bps to 1.8 kbps and a range of 30 m. By using a lower bit rate of 10-20 bps, we can further increase the range to 100 m. As smartphones and watches are increasingly being used in underwater scenarios, our software-based approach has the potential to make underwater messaging capabilities widely available to anyone with a mobile device.

This platform was previously used to collect data for thermal comfort, and this work extends its use to other domains. Several research participants took part in a proof-of-concept experiment by wearing a smartwatch to collect their micro-survey question preferences and perception responses for two of the question sets. Participants were also asked to install an indoor localization app on their phone to detect where precisely in the building they completed the survey.

The first relaxation of these restrictions allowed German citizens to mostly return to their normal training and exercise behavior, yet the long-term impact of the recurring measures (i.e. the \"Lockdown\", \"Lockdown light\" as well as the \"Corona Emergency Break\" in the case of Germany) remain rather under-investigated. Using a survey of (n=108) German sportspersons, we measured a significant decline of sporting activities even within the intermediary phases without major pandemic constraints. To evaluate the capabilities of digital training applications in countering these effects, we additionally recorded the usage of, among others, apps, trackers, videos and conferencing systems and identified the most important as well as missing and/or essential features with regards to their capabilities of facilitating individual sport and training in times without access to facilities or social contacts. Effectively, the usage of smart watches, online videos and conferences increased significantly when compared to before the pandemic; and especially online videos and conferences contributed to higher training frequencies. Data-driven or individual feedback, motivation and collaboration revealed to be the most important or even necessary functions for users of digital training applications to counter the decline of social components of training.|\n", "2206.11578": "|**2022-06-23**|**Doubly-online changepoint detection for monitoring health status during sports activities**|Mattia Stival et.al.|[2206.11578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11578v1)|null|We provide an online framework for analyzing data recorded by smart watches during running activities. In particular, we focus on identifying variations in the behavior of one or more measurements caused by changes in physical condition, such as physical discomfort, periods of prolonged de-training, or even the malfunction of measuring devices. Our framework considers data as a sequence of running activities represented by multivariate time series of physical and biometric data. We combine classical changepoint detection models with an unknown number of components with Gaussian state space models to detect distributional changes between a sequence of activities. The model considers multiple sources of dependence due to the sequential nature of subsequent activities, the autocorrelation structure within each activity, and the contemporaneous dependence between different variables. We provide an online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm involving a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approximation of changepoint predicted probabilities. As a byproduct of our model assumptions, our proposed approach processes sequences of multivariate time series in a doubly-online framework. While classical changepoint models detect changes between subsequent activities, the state space framework coupled with the online EM algorithm provides the additional benefit of estimating the real-time probability that a current activity is a changepoint.|\n"}}}
