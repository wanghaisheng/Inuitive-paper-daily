This performance is attributed to the coupling effect of Ag-O-Ni sites to enhance the hydrogenation of CO2 and weaken the CO adsorption, resulting in 1434 mmol g-1 h-1 of CO yield at 300 degree, surpassing any low-temperature RWGS performances ever reported. Building on this, we integrated the 2D Ni1Ag0.02O1 supported photothermal RWGS with commercial photovoltaic electrolytic water splitting, leading to the realization of 103 m2 scale artificial photosynthesis system with a daily CO yield of 18.70 m3, a photochemical energy conversion efficiency of >16%, over 90% H2 ultilazation efficiency, outperforming other types of artificial photosynthesis. The results of this research chart a promising course for designing practical, natural sunlight-driven artificial photosynthesis systems and highly efficient platinum-free CO2 hydrogenation catalysts. This work is a significant step towards harnessing solar energy more efficiently and sustainably, opening exciting possibilities for future research and development in this area.
