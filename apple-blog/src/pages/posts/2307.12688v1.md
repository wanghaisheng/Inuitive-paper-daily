Session types inherit this restriction, which precludes them from fully modelling timeouts -- a key programming feature to handle failures. To address this deficiency, we present (binary) TimeOut Asynchronous Session Types ({TOAST}) as an extension to (binary) asynchronous timed session types to permit mixed-choice. {TOAST} deploy timing constraints to regulate the use of mixed-choice so as to preserve communication safety. We provide a new behavioural semantics for {TOAST} which guarantees progress in the presence of mixed-choice. Building upon {TOAST}, we provide a calculus featuring process timers which is capable of modelling timeouts using a $\mathtt{receive\text{-}after}$ pattern, much like Erlang, and informally illustrate the correspondence with TOAST specifications.
