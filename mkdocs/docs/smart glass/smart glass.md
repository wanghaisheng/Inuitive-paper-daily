Short, high gain fibers can be used in e.g., distributed feedback fiber lasers (DFFL) that offer sought after performance suitable for a broad range of applications in modern photonics. DFFLs offer superior stability and narrower linewidth compared to conventional fiber lasers. Tunable, narrow laser sources with output in eye-safe spectrum are desired for sensing, signal multiplexing, LIDAR systems etc. In this work we present DFFL obtained using Laser-Powder-Deposition made Er-doped silica fiber. Milliwatt level, ultra-narrow laser line (less than 4 kHz) was obtained using phase-shifted grating in 16 mm long fiber. The backward slope efficiency was as high as 24% when pumping at 976 nm. The results presented in this work showcase new possibilities in fiber fabrication that were unlocked through laser-assisted AM. This fiber laser sets the stage for the future of rapid fabrication of advanced fiber devices through unconventional manufacturing routes.|

Our research focuses on the development of non-invasive techniques based on the Object Detection (OD) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and verify the proper use of various types of PPE such as helmets, safety glasses, masks, and protective clothing. This study proposes the SH17 Dataset, consisting of 8,099 annotated images containing 75,994 instances of 17 classes collected from diverse industrial environments, to train and validate the OD models. We have trained state-of-the-art OD models for benchmarking, and initial results demonstrate promising accuracy levels with You Only Look Once (YOLO)v9-e model variant exceeding 70.9% in PPE detection. The performance of the model validation on cross-domain datasets suggests that integrating these technologies can significantly improve safety management systems, providing a scalable and efficient solution for industries striving to meet human safety regulations and protect their workforce. The dataset is available at https://github.com/ahmadmughees/sh17dataset.|

Unlike Centralized FL, Decentralized FL (DFL) employs a network architecture that eliminates the need for a central server, allowing direct communication among clients and leading to significant communication resource savings. However, due to data heterogeneity, not all neighboring nodes contribute to enhancing the local client's model performance. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\emph{AFIND+}}, a simple yet efficient algorithm for sampling and aggregating neighbors in DFL, with the aim of leveraging collaboration to improve clients' model performance. AFIND+ identifies helpful neighbors, adaptively adjusts the number of selected neighbors, and strategically aggregates the sampled neighbors' models based on their contributions. Numerical results on real-world datasets with diverse data partitions demonstrate that AFIND+ outperforms other sampling algorithms in DFL and is compatible with most existing DFL optimization algorithms.|

This study explores the adoption of smart farming practices among KSA farmers. Due to the geographical location and nature of KSA, it faces significant challenges in agriculture. The objective of this research is to discuss how IoT will enhance agriculture in KSA and identify its current usage by conducting a study on Saudi farmers with varying ages, regions, and years of experience. The results indicate that 90% of the farmers encounter challenges in farming, and all of them express interest in adopting smart farming to address these issues. While 60% of farmers are currently utilizing IoT technologies, they encounter challenges in implementing smart farming practices. Thus, smart farming presents solutions to prevalent challenges including adverse weather, water scarcity, and labor shortages, though barriers include cost and educational challenges.|

Recent studies have identified transient interpenetration of the long-chain rings contributing to dynamic arrest on the center-of-mass level. Interpenetration of rings is proposed as an approach to facilitate glass formation in polymer melts. In this work, inspired by recent advances in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked polymers, we investigate glass transition on the nanometer-scale segments influenced by permanent interpenetration of rings using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that decreasing chain length in the mechanically interlocked system is equivalent to inducing an effective chain stiffness on the sub-rings. The induced stiffness provides a unified explanation for these unique structural features and transient dynamic arrest in the system of interlocked rings with rather short chains. Further, a crossover is observed in the scaling relation between localization and glassy depth upon cooling. Our work reveals a dynamic transition from weak to strong caging at the crossover temperature. According to the localization model, we demonstrate that the chain stiffness increases the critical temperature and oscillation distance, therefore leads to more fragile dynamics and deeper glassy state. These findings are consistent with the predictions of molecular simulations and theories for polymers with real local stiffness. Our work deepens the understanding of the role of induced stiffness on glass transition, and opens up a new direction to design rich glass materials by manipulating stiffness through mechanical bonds.|

They were first introduced by Ethereum in 2014 and have since been used for various applications such as security tokens, voting, gambling, non-fungible tokens, self-sovereign identities, stock taking, decentralized finances, decentralized exchanges, and atomic swaps. Since smart contracts are immutable, their bugs cannot be fixed, which may lead to significant monetary losses. While many researchers have focused on testing smart contracts, our recent work has highlighted a gap between test adequacy and test data generation, despite numerous efforts in both fields. Our framework, Griffin, tackles this deficiency by employing a targeted symbolic execution technique for generating test data. This tool can be used in diverse applications, such as killing the survived mutants in mutation testing, validating static analysis alarms, creating counter-examples for safety conditions, and reaching manually selected lines of code. This paper discusses how smart contracts differ from legacy software in targeted symbolic execution and how these differences can affect the tool structure, leading us to propose an enhanced version of the control-flow graph for Solidity smart contracts called CFG+. We also discuss how Griffin can utilize custom heuristics to explore the program space and find the test data that reaches a target line while considering a safety condition in a reasonable execution time. We conducted experiments involving an extensive set of smart contracts, target lines, and safety conditions based on real-world faults and test suites from related tools. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that Griffin can effectively identify the required test data within a reasonable timeframe.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Smart Vision-Language Reasoners**|Denisa Roberts et.al.|[2407.04212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04212v1)|[link](https://github.com/smarter-vlm/smarter)|In this article, we investigate vision-language models (VLM) as reasoners. The ability to form abstractions underlies mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and other Math AI tasks. Several formalisms have been given to these underlying abstractions and skills utilized by humans and intelligent systems for reasoning. Furthermore, human reasoning is inherently multimodal, and as such, we focus our investigations on multimodal AI. In this article, we employ the abstractions given in the SMART task (Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task) introduced in \cite{cherian2022deep} as meta-reasoning and problem-solving skills along eight axes: math, counting, path, measure, logic, spatial, and pattern. We investigate the ability of vision-language models to reason along these axes and seek avenues of improvement. Including composite representations with vision-language cross-attention enabled learning multimodal representations adaptively from fused frozen pretrained backbones for better visual grounding. Furthermore, proper hyperparameter and other training choices led to strong improvements (up to $48\%$ gain in accuracy) on the SMART task, further underscoring the power of deep multimodal learning. The smartest VLM, which includes a novel QF multimodal layer, improves upon the best previous baselines in every one of the eight fundamental reasoning skills.

While recent efforts on Audio SSMs have reported encouraging results, two main limitations remain: First, in 10-second short audio tagging tasks, Audio SSMs still underperform compared to Transformer-based models such as Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST). Second, although Audio SSMs theoretically support long audio inputs, their actual performance with long audio has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address these limitations, in this paper, 1) We applied knowledge distillation in audio space model training, resulting in a model called Knowledge Distilled Audio SSM (DASS). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first SSM that outperforms the Transformers on AudioSet and achieves an mAP of 47.6; and 2) We designed a new test called Audio Needle In A Haystack (Audio NIAH). We find that DASS, trained with only 10-second audio clips, can retrieve sound events in audio recordings up to 2.5 hours long, while the AST model fails when the input is just 50 seconds, demonstrating SSMs are indeed more duration scalable.|

As a result, many recent empirical studies focus on studying the effectiveness of gamified or game-based educational experiences. The findings of these studies are very diverse, showing both positive and negative effects, and thus calling for comparative meta-studies. In this paper we review and analyze different studies, aiming to summarise and evaluate controlled experiments conducted within different scientific disciplines. We focus on the clarity of non-experimental conditions' descriptions and show that in most cases a. educational methods used in control groups' activities are poorly described, b. educational materials used in control groups' activities are often unclear, and c. the starting conditions are unclear. We also noticed that studies in the fields of computer science and engineering, in general, report results more clearly than in other fields. Based on the above finding, we conclude with a few recommendations for the execution of future empirical studies of games in education for the sake of allowing a more structured comparison.|

When $\sigma<0$, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition between the superfluid and the localized phase is driven by the long-range correlations and the Luttinger parameter $K$ takes the critical value $K_c(\sigma)=3/2-\sigma/2$. The localized phase is a Bose glass for $\sigma>\sigma_c=3-\pi^2/3\simeq -0.289868$, and a Mott glass -- characterized by a vanishing compressibility and a gapless conductivity -- when $\sigma<\sigma_c$. Our conclusions, based on the nonperturbative functional renormalization group and perturbative renormalization group, are confirmed by the study of the case $\sigma=-1$, corresponding to a perfectly correlated disorder in space, where the model is exactly solvable in the semiclassical limit $K\to 0^+$.|

Existing studies typically require meticulous labeling of both atomic and complex activities, a task that is labor-intensive and prone to errors due to the scarcity and inaccuracies of available datasets. Most prior research has focused on datasets that either precisely label atomic activities or, at minimum, their sequence approaches that are often impractical in real world settings.In response, we introduce VCHAR (Variance-Driven Complex Human Activity Recognition), a novel framework that treats the outputs of atomic activities as a distribution over specified intervals. Leveraging generative methodologies, VCHAR elucidates the reasoning behind complex activity classifications through video-based explanations, accessible to users without prior machine learning expertise. Our evaluation across three publicly available datasets demonstrates that VCHAR enhances the accuracy of complex activity recognition without necessitating precise temporal or sequential labeling of atomic activities. Furthermore, user studies confirm that VCHAR's explanations are more intelligible compared to existing methods, facilitating a broader understanding of complex activity recognition among non-experts.|

It adjusts the proposal distribution of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to maximize the sampling efficiency, using a formalism inspired by reinforcement learning. In this work, we first extend the policy-guided method to deal with a general state space, comprising for instance both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom, and then apply it to a few paradigmatic models of glass-forming mixtures. We assess the efficiency of a set of physically-inspired moves, whose proposal distributions are optimized through on-policy learning. Compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods, the optimized proposals are two orders of magnitude faster for an additive soft sphere mixture, but yield a much more limited speed-up for the well-studied Kob-Andersen model. We discuss the current limitations of the method and suggest possible ways to improve it.|
|**2024-07-03**|**Anomaly-based Framework for Detecting Power Overloading Cyberattacks in Smart Grid AMI**|Abdelaziz Amara Korba et.al.|[2407.03264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03264v1)|null|The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components of the smart grid. It provides interactive services for managing billing and electricity consumption, but it also introduces new vectors for cyberattacks. Although, the devastating and severe impact of power overloading cyberattacks on smart grid AMI, few researches in the literature have addressed them. In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker's strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.|

We make his discussion mathematically rigorous, keeping it elementary, using his other idea. The resulting model leads to accurate quantitative results and allows us to derive a well-known formula from optics. In the process, we get acquainted with mathematical tools such as Smirnov's fermionic observables, transfer matrices, and spectral radii. Quantum walks and the six-vertex model arise as the next step in this direction.|

Most anomaly detection approaches using defect detection datasets, such as MVTec AD, employ one-class models that require fitting separate models for each class. On the contrary, unified models eliminate the need for fitting separate models for each class and significantly reduce cost and memory requirements. Thus, in this work, we experiment with considering a unified multi-class setup. Our experimental study shows that multi-class models perform at par with one-class models for the standard MVTec AD dataset. Hence, this indicates that there may not be a need to learn separate object/class-wise models when the object classes are significantly different from each other, as is the case of the dataset considered. Furthermore, we have deployed three different unified lightweight architectures on the CPU and an edge device (NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX). We analyze the quantized multi-class anomaly detection models in terms of latency and memory requirements for deployment on the edge device while comparing quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) for performance at different precision widths. In addition, we explored two different methods of calibration required in post-training scenarios and show that one of them performs notably better, highlighting its importance for unsupervised tasks. Due to quantization, the performance drop in PTQ is further compensated by QAT, which yields at par performance with the original 32-bit Floating point in two of the models considered.|

Traditional localization relies on relative methods utilizing the positions of anchors within a home environment, yet struggles with precision due to inherent inaccuracies in these anchor positions. In response, we introduce a cutting-edge smartphone-based localization system for IoT devices, leveraging the precise positioning capabilities of smartphones equipped with motion sensors. Our system employs artificial intelligence (AI) to merge channel state information from proximal trajectory points of a single smartphone, significantly enhancing line of sight (LoS) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy, particularly under severe multipath conditions. Additionally, we have developed an AI-based anomaly detection algorithm to further increase the reliability of LoSAoA estimation. This algorithm improves measurement reliability by analyzing the correlation between the accuracy of reversed feature reconstruction and the LoS-AoA estimation. Utilizing a straightforward least squares algorithm in conjunction with accurate LoS-AoA estimation and smartphone positional data, our system efficiently identifies IoT device locations. Validated through extensive simulations and experimental tests with a receiving antenna array comprising just two patch antenna elements in the horizontal direction, our methodology has been shown to attain decimeter-level localization accuracy in nearly 90% of cases, demonstrating robust performance even in challenging real-world scenarios. Additionally, our proposed anomaly detection algorithm trained on Wi-Fi data can be directly applied to ultra-wideband, also outperforming the most advanced techniques.|

For this security paradigm to be fully realized, it necessitates the active participation of small-scale power suppliers (SPSs) in implementing honeypots and engaging in collaborative data sharing with traditional power retailers (TPRs). To motivate this interaction, TPRs incentivize data sharing with tangible rewards. However, without access to an SPS's confidential data, it is daunting for TPRs to validate shared data, thereby risking SPSs' privacy and increasing sharing costs due to voluminous honeypot logs. These challenges can be resolved by utilizing Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that allows for model training without data relocation. However, the conventional FL algorithm lacks the requisite functionality for both the security defense model and the rewards system of the AMI network. This work presents two solutions: first, an enhanced and cost-efficient FedAvg algorithm incorporating a novel data quality measure, and second, FedPot, the development of an effective security model with a fair incentives mechanism under an FL architecture. Accordingly, SPSs are limited to sharing the ML model they learn after efficiently measuring their local data quality, whereas TPRs can verify the participants' uploaded models and fairly compensate each participant for their contributions through rewards. Simulation results, drawn from realistic mircorgrid network log datasets, demonstrate that the proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art techniques by enhancing the security model and guaranteeing fair reward distributions.|

Compliance with strict privacy and security policies, such as those required by laws like HIPAA, is critical to protect PHI. Blockchain technology, which offers a decentralized and tamper-evident ledger system, hold promise in policy compliance. This system ensures the authenticity and integrity of PHI while facilitating patient consent management. In this work, we propose a blockchain technology that integrates smart contracts to partially automate consent-related processes and ensuring that PHI access and sharing follow patient preferences and legal requirements.|

Most of these IoT devices lack ready-to-use hardware or software for power measurement. A cost-effective solution is to use low-end consumer-grade power meters. However, these low-end power meters cannot provide accurate instantaneous power measurements. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use approach to derive an instantaneous software-based energy estimation model with only low-end power meters based on data-driven analysis through machine learning. Our solution is demonstrated with a Jetson Nano board and Ruideng UM25C USB power meter. Various machine learning methods combined with our smart data collection method and physical measurement are explored. Benchmarks were used to evaluate the derived software-power model for the Jetson Nano board and Raspberry Pi. The results show that 92% accuracy can be achieved compared to the long-duration measurement. A kernel module that can collect running traces of utilization and frequencies needed is developed, together with the power model derived, for power prediction for programs running in real environment.|

This method effectively combines edge devices and LLMs to help elderly people in their daily activities, such as reminding them to take pills or handling emergencies like falls. The LLM-based edge device can also serve as an interface to interact with elderly people, especially with memory issue, assisting them in their daily lives. By deploying such a system, we believe that the smart sensing system can improve the quality of life for older people and provide more efficient protection|

However, in a real-time scenario, the performance of the gesture recognition system is sometimes affected due to the presence of complex background, low-light illumination, occlusion problems, etc. Another issue is building a fast and robust gesture-controlled human-computer interface (HCI) in the real-time scenario. The overall objective of this paper is to develop an efficient hand gesture detection and classification model using a channel-pruned YOLOv5-small model and utilize the model to build a gesture-controlled HCI with a quick response time (in ms) and higher detection speed (in fps). First, the YOLOv5s model is chosen for the gesture detection task. Next, the model is simplified by using a channel-pruned algorithm. After that, the pruned model is further fine-tuned to ensure detection efficiency. We have compared our suggested scheme with other state-of-the-art works, and it is observed that our model has shown superior results in terms of mAP (mean average precision), precision (\%), recall (\%), and F1-score (\%), fast inference time (in ms), and detection speed (in fps). Our proposed method paves the way for deploying a pruned YOLOv5s model for a real-time gesture-command-based HCI to control some applications, such as the VLC media player, Spotify player, etc., using correctly classified gesture commands in real-time scenarios. The average detection speed of our proposed system has reached more than 60 frames per second (fps) in real-time, which meets the perfect requirement in real-time application control.|

Probabilistic Reservoir Computing (RC) is well-suited for long-term chaotic predictions by handling complex dynamic systems. Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) devices in spintronics, with their nonlinear and probabilistic operations, can enhance performance in these tasks. This study proposes an RC system utilizing SOT devices for predicting chaotic dynamics. By simulating the reservoir in an RC network with SOT devices that achieve nonlinear resistance changes with random distribution, we enhance the robustness for the predictive capability of the model. The RC network predicted the behaviors of the Mackey-Glass and Lorenz chaotic systems, demonstrating that stochastic SOT devices significantly improve long-term prediction accuracy.|

Predicting rapid crack propagation in the presence of inhomogeneities remains a challenge. Linear perturbations leave the net speed of fracture unchanged. We obtain a nonlinear equation of motion for planar crack fronts to gain insight into the dynamic fracture of moderately heterogeneous solids. The coupling of the front geometry to the heterogeneity landscape renormalizes the energy dissipation and the crack velocity. In materials whose toughness is weakly sensitive to crack speed, such as silica glass, heterogeneity results in increased dissipation and slower crack propagation. However, heterogeneity has a reduced effect and may even facilitate fracture in strongly velocity-dependent materials.|

Developing an effective, transparent, and privacy-preserving reputation model necessitates on-chain implementation using smart contracts. However, managing task evaluation and reputation updates alongside crowdsourcing transactions on-chain substantially strains system scalability and performance. This paper introduces RollupTheCrowd, a novel blockchain-powered crowdsourcing framework that leverages zkRollups to enhance system scalability while protecting user privacy. Our framework includes an effective and privacy-preserving reputation model that gauges workers' trustworthiness by assessing their crowdsourcing interactions. To alleviate the load on our blockchain, we employ an off-chain storage scheme, optimizing RollupTheCrowd's performance. Utilizing smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs, our Rollup layer achieves a significant 20x reduction in gas consumption. To prove the feasibility of the proposed framework, we developed a proof-of-concept implementation using cutting-edge tools. The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of RollupTheCrowd, validating its potential for real-world application scenarios.|

In this work, we present a new dataset, called VRBiom, of periocular videos acquired using a Virtual Reality headset. The VRBiom, targeted at biometric applications, consists of 900 short videos acquired from 25 individuals recorded in the NIR spectrum. These 10s long videos have been captured using the internal tracking cameras of Meta Quest Pro at 72 FPS. To encompass real-world variations, the dataset includes recordings under three gaze conditions: steady, moving, and partially closed eyes. We have also ensured an equal split of recordings without and with glasses to facilitate the analysis of eye-wear. These videos, characterized by non-frontal views of the eye and relatively low spatial resolutions (400 x 400), can be instrumental in advancing state-of-the-art research across various biometric applications. The VRBiom dataset can be utilized to evaluate, train, or adapt models for biometric use-cases such as iris and/or periocular recognition and associated sub-tasks such as detection and semantic segmentation.   In addition to data from real individuals, we have included around 1100 PA constructed from 92 PA instruments. These PAIs fall into six categories constructed through combinations of print attacks (real and synthetic identities), fake 3D eyeballs, plastic eyes, and various types of masks and mannequins. These PA videos, combined with genuine (bona-fide) data, can be utilized to address concerns related to spoofing, which is a significant threat if these devices are to be used for authentication.   The VRBiom dataset is publicly available for research purposes related to biometric applications only.|
|**2024-07-02**|**Magnetic critical phenomena and low temperature re-entrant spin-glass features of Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy**|Abhinav Kumar Khorwal et.al.|[2407.02149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02149v1)|null|A detailed investigation of the structural and magnetic properties, including magnetocaloric effect, re-entrant spin-glass behavior at low temperature, and critical behavior in polycrystalline Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy is reported. The prepared alloy crystallizes in a cubic CsCl-type crystal structure with Pm-3m space group. The temperature-dependent magnetization data reveals a second-order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition ($\sim$ 122.9 K), which is further supported by the analysis of the magnetocaloric effect. The isothermal magnetization loops show a soft ferromagnetic behavior of the studied alloy and also reveal an itinerant character of the underlying exchange interactions. In order to understand the nature of magnetic interactions, the critical exponents for spontaneous magnetization, initial magnetic susceptibility, and critical MH isotherm are determined using Modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher plots, and critical isotherm analysis. The derived critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.363(2), $\gamma$ = 1.384(3), and $\delta$ = 4.81(3) confirm the critical behavior similar to that of a 3D-Heisenberg-type ferromagnet with short-range exchange interactions that are found to decay with distance as J(r) $\approx$ r$^{-4.936}$. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the AC susceptibility data suggests that the frequency-dependent shifting of the peak temperatures is well explained using standard dynamic scaling laws such as the critical slowing down model and Vogel-Fulcher law, and confirms the signature of re-entrant spin-glass features in Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy. Furthermore, maximum magnetic entropy change of $\sim$ 1.92 J/kg-K and relative cooling power of $\sim$ 496 J/kg at 50 kOe applied magnetic field are determined from magnetocaloric studies that are comparable to those of other Mn-Fe-Al systems.|

In settings with many competing optima, marginal ones tend to attract algorithms and physical dynamics. Often, the important family of marginal attractors are a vanishing minority compared with nonmarginal optima and other unstable stationary points. We introduce a generic technique for conditioning the statistics of stationary points in random landscapes on their marginality, and apply it in three isotropic settings with qualitatively different structure: in the spherical spin-glasses, where the energy is Gaussian and its Hessian is GOE; in multispherical spin glasses, which are Gaussian but non-GOE; and in sums of squared spherical random functions, which are non-Gaussian. In these problems we are able to fully characterize the distribution of marginal optima in the landscape, including when they are in the minority.|

The switching capability is facilitated by the phase change material and the structure is optimized by machine learning. Our design not only advances the machine-learning-based development of metamaterials but also has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions and contribute to the goal of achieving carbon neutrality.|
