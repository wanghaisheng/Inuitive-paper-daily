|**2024-07-05**|**Smart Sampling: Helping from Friendly Neighbors for Decentralized Federated Learning**|Lin Wang et.al.|[2407.04460v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04460v1)|null|Federated Learning (FL) is gaining widespread interest for its ability to share knowledge while preserving privacy and reducing communication costs. Unlike Centralized FL, Decentralized FL (DFL) employs a network architecture that eliminates the need for a central server, allowing direct communication among clients and leading to significant communication resource savings. However, due to data heterogeneity, not all neighboring nodes contribute to enhancing the local client's model performance. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\emph{AFIND+}}, a simple yet efficient algorithm for sampling and aggregating neighbors in DFL, with the aim of leveraging collaboration to improve clients' model performance. AFIND+ identifies helpful neighbors, adaptively adjusts the number of selected neighbors, and strategically aggregates the sampled neighbors' models based on their contributions. Numerical results on real-world datasets with diverse data partitions demonstrate that AFIND+ outperforms other sampling algorithms in DFL and is compatible with most existing DFL optimization algorithms.|

The sim2real approach faces challenges due to mismatches between simulation and reality. These discrepancies arise from inaccuracies in modeling physical phenomena and asynchronous control, among other factors. To this end, we introduce EAGERx, a framework with a unified software pipeline for both real and simulated robot learning. It can support various simulators and aids in integrating state, action and time-scale abstractions to facilitate learning. EAGERx's integrated delay simulation, domain randomization features, and proposed synchronization algorithm contribute to narrowing the sim2real gap. We demonstrate (in the context of robot learning and beyond) the efficacy of EAGERx in accommodating diverse robotic systems and maintaining consistent simulation behavior. EAGERx is open source and its code is available at https://eagerx.readthedocs.io.|

This study explores the adoption of smart farming practices among KSA farmers. Due to the geographical location and nature of KSA, it faces significant challenges in agriculture. The objective of this research is to discuss how IoT will enhance agriculture in KSA and identify its current usage by conducting a study on Saudi farmers with varying ages, regions, and years of experience. The results indicate that 90% of the farmers encounter challenges in farming, and all of them express interest in adopting smart farming to address these issues. While 60% of farmers are currently utilizing IoT technologies, they encounter challenges in implementing smart farming practices. Thus, smart farming presents solutions to prevalent challenges including adverse weather, water scarcity, and labor shortages, though barriers include cost and educational challenges.|

They were first introduced by Ethereum in 2014 and have since been used for various applications such as security tokens, voting, gambling, non-fungible tokens, self-sovereign identities, stock taking, decentralized finances, decentralized exchanges, and atomic swaps. Since smart contracts are immutable, their bugs cannot be fixed, which may lead to significant monetary losses. While many researchers have focused on testing smart contracts, our recent work has highlighted a gap between test adequacy and test data generation, despite numerous efforts in both fields. Our framework, Griffin, tackles this deficiency by employing a targeted symbolic execution technique for generating test data. This tool can be used in diverse applications, such as killing the survived mutants in mutation testing, validating static analysis alarms, creating counter-examples for safety conditions, and reaching manually selected lines of code. This paper discusses how smart contracts differ from legacy software in targeted symbolic execution and how these differences can affect the tool structure, leading us to propose an enhanced version of the control-flow graph for Solidity smart contracts called CFG+. We also discuss how Griffin can utilize custom heuristics to explore the program space and find the test data that reaches a target line while considering a safety condition in a reasonable execution time. We conducted experiments involving an extensive set of smart contracts, target lines, and safety conditions based on real-world faults and test suites from related tools. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that Griffin can effectively identify the required test data within a reasonable timeframe.|

The ability to form abstractions underlies mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and other Math AI tasks. Several formalisms have been given to these underlying abstractions and skills utilized by humans and intelligent systems for reasoning. Furthermore, human reasoning is inherently multimodal, and as such, we focus our investigations on multimodal AI. In this article, we employ the abstractions given in the SMART task (Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task) introduced in \cite{cherian2022deep} as meta-reasoning and problem-solving skills along eight axes: math, counting, path, measure, logic, spatial, and pattern. We investigate the ability of vision-language models to reason along these axes and seek avenues of improvement. Including composite representations with vision-language cross-attention enabled learning multimodal representations adaptively from fused frozen pretrained backbones for better visual grounding. Furthermore, proper hyperparameter and other training choices led to strong improvements (up to $48\%$ gain in accuracy) on the SMART task, further underscoring the power of deep multimodal learning. The smartest VLM, which includes a novel QF multimodal layer, improves upon the best previous baselines in every one of the eight fundamental reasoning skills.

As a result, many recent empirical studies focus on studying the effectiveness of gamified or game-based educational experiences. The findings of these studies are very diverse, showing both positive and negative effects, and thus calling for comparative meta-studies. In this paper we review and analyze different studies, aiming to summarise and evaluate controlled experiments conducted within different scientific disciplines. We focus on the clarity of non-experimental conditions' descriptions and show that in most cases a. educational methods used in control groups' activities are poorly described, b. educational materials used in control groups' activities are often unclear, and c. the starting conditions are unclear. We also noticed that studies in the fields of computer science and engineering, in general, report results more clearly than in other fields. Based on the above finding, we conclude with a few recommendations for the execution of future empirical studies of games in education for the sake of allowing a more structured comparison.|

Existing studies typically require meticulous labeling of both atomic and complex activities, a task that is labor-intensive and prone to errors due to the scarcity and inaccuracies of available datasets. Most prior research has focused on datasets that either precisely label atomic activities or, at minimum, their sequence approaches that are often impractical in real world settings.In response, we introduce VCHAR (Variance-Driven Complex Human Activity Recognition), a novel framework that treats the outputs of atomic activities as a distribution over specified intervals. Leveraging generative methodologies, VCHAR elucidates the reasoning behind complex activity classifications through video-based explanations, accessible to users without prior machine learning expertise. Our evaluation across three publicly available datasets demonstrates that VCHAR enhances the accuracy of complex activity recognition without necessitating precise temporal or sequential labeling of atomic activities. Furthermore, user studies confirm that VCHAR's explanations are more intelligible compared to existing methods, facilitating a broader understanding of complex activity recognition among non-experts.|
|**2024-07-03**|**Anomaly-based Framework for Detecting Power Overloading Cyberattacks in Smart Grid AMI**|Abdelaziz Amara Korba et.al.|[2407.03264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03264v1)|null|The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components of the smart grid. It provides interactive services for managing billing and electricity consumption, but it also introduces new vectors for cyberattacks. Although, the devastating and severe impact of power overloading cyberattacks on smart grid AMI, few researches in the literature have addressed them. In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker's strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.|
|**2024-07-03**|**Unified Anomaly Detection methods on Edge Device using Knowledge Distillation and Quantization**|Sushovan Jena et.al.|[2407.02968v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02968v1)|null|With the rapid advances in deep learning and smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0, there is an imperative for high-throughput, high-performance, and fully integrated visual inspection systems. Most anomaly detection approaches using defect detection datasets, such as MVTec AD, employ one-class models that require fitting separate models for each class. On the contrary, unified models eliminate the need for fitting separate models for each class and significantly reduce cost and memory requirements. Thus, in this work, we experiment with considering a unified multi-class setup. Our experimental study shows that multi-class models perform at par with one-class models for the standard MVTec AD dataset. Hence, this indicates that there may not be a need to learn separate object/class-wise models when the object classes are significantly different from each other, as is the case of the dataset considered. Furthermore, we have deployed three different unified lightweight architectures on the CPU and an edge device (NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX). We analyze the quantized multi-class anomaly detection models in terms of latency and memory requirements for deployment on the edge device while comparing quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) for performance at different precision widths. In addition, we explored two different methods of calibration required in post-training scenarios and show that one of them performs notably better, highlighting its importance for unsupervised tasks. Due to quantization, the performance drop in PTQ is further compensated by QAT, which yields at par performance with the original 32-bit Floating point in two of the models considered.|
|**2024-07-03**|**Efficient IoT Devices Localization Through Wi-Fi CSI Feature Fusion and Anomaly Detection**|Yan Li et.al.|[2407.02919v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02919v1)|null|Internet of Things (IoT) device localization is fundamental to smart home functionalities, including indoor navigation and tracking of individuals. Traditional localization relies on relative methods utilizing the positions of anchors within a home environment, yet struggles with precision due to inherent inaccuracies in these anchor positions. In response, we introduce a cutting-edge smartphone-based localization system for IoT devices, leveraging the precise positioning capabilities of smartphones equipped with motion sensors. Our system employs artificial intelligence (AI) to merge channel state information from proximal trajectory points of a single smartphone, significantly enhancing line of sight (LoS) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy, particularly under severe multipath conditions. Additionally, we have developed an AI-based anomaly detection algorithm to further increase the reliability of LoSAoA estimation. This algorithm improves measurement reliability by analyzing the correlation between the accuracy of reversed feature reconstruction and the LoS-AoA estimation. Utilizing a straightforward least squares algorithm in conjunction with accurate LoS-AoA estimation and smartphone positional data, our system efficiently identifies IoT device locations. Validated through extensive simulations and experimental tests with a receiving antenna array comprising just two patch antenna elements in the horizontal direction, our methodology has been shown to attain decimeter-level localization accuracy in nearly 90% of cases, demonstrating robust performance even in challenging real-world scenarios. Additionally, our proposed anomaly detection algorithm trained on Wi-Fi data can be directly applied to ultra-wideband, also outperforming the most advanced techniques.|

For this security paradigm to be fully realized, it necessitates the active participation of small-scale power suppliers (SPSs) in implementing honeypots and engaging in collaborative data sharing with traditional power retailers (TPRs). To motivate this interaction, TPRs incentivize data sharing with tangible rewards. However, without access to an SPS's confidential data, it is daunting for TPRs to validate shared data, thereby risking SPSs' privacy and increasing sharing costs due to voluminous honeypot logs. These challenges can be resolved by utilizing Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that allows for model training without data relocation. However, the conventional FL algorithm lacks the requisite functionality for both the security defense model and the rewards system of the AMI network. This work presents two solutions: first, an enhanced and cost-efficient FedAvg algorithm incorporating a novel data quality measure, and second, FedPot, the development of an effective security model with a fair incentives mechanism under an FL architecture. Accordingly, SPSs are limited to sharing the ML model they learn after efficiently measuring their local data quality, whereas TPRs can verify the participants' uploaded models and fairly compensate each participant for their contributions through rewards. Simulation results, drawn from realistic mircorgrid network log datasets, demonstrate that the proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art techniques by enhancing the security model and guaranteeing fair reward distributions.|

Compliance with strict privacy and security policies, such as those required by laws like HIPAA, is critical to protect PHI. Blockchain technology, which offers a decentralized and tamper-evident ledger system, hold promise in policy compliance. This system ensures the authenticity and integrity of PHI while facilitating patient consent management. In this work, we propose a blockchain technology that integrates smart contracts to partially automate consent-related processes and ensuring that PHI access and sharing follow patient preferences and legal requirements.|

Most of these IoT devices lack ready-to-use hardware or software for power measurement. A cost-effective solution is to use low-end consumer-grade power meters. However, these low-end power meters cannot provide accurate instantaneous power measurements. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use approach to derive an instantaneous software-based energy estimation model with only low-end power meters based on data-driven analysis through machine learning. Our solution is demonstrated with a Jetson Nano board and Ruideng UM25C USB power meter. Various machine learning methods combined with our smart data collection method and physical measurement are explored. Benchmarks were used to evaluate the derived software-power model for the Jetson Nano board and Raspberry Pi. The results show that 92% accuracy can be achieved compared to the long-duration measurement. A kernel module that can collect running traces of utilization and frequencies needed is developed, together with the power model derived, for power prediction for programs running in real environment.|

However, the reasoning ability of edge devices is constrained by the classic machine learning model capacity. In this paper, we present a non-invasive ambient sensing system that can detect multiple activities and apply large language models (LLMs) to reason the activity sequences. This method effectively combines edge devices and LLMs to help elderly people in their daily activities, such as reminding them to take pills or handling emergencies like falls. The LLM-based edge device can also serve as an interface to interact with elderly people, especially with memory issue, assisting them in their daily lives. By deploying such a system, we believe that the smart sensing system can improve the quality of life for older people and provide more efficient protection|

However, in a real-time scenario, the performance of the gesture recognition system is sometimes affected due to the presence of complex background, low-light illumination, occlusion problems, etc. Another issue is building a fast and robust gesture-controlled human-computer interface (HCI) in the real-time scenario. The overall objective of this paper is to develop an efficient hand gesture detection and classification model using a channel-pruned YOLOv5-small model and utilize the model to build a gesture-controlled HCI with a quick response time (in ms) and higher detection speed (in fps). First, the YOLOv5s model is chosen for the gesture detection task. Next, the model is simplified by using a channel-pruned algorithm. After that, the pruned model is further fine-tuned to ensure detection efficiency. We have compared our suggested scheme with other state-of-the-art works, and it is observed that our model has shown superior results in terms of mAP (mean average precision), precision (\%), recall (\%), and F1-score (\%), fast inference time (in ms), and detection speed (in fps). Our proposed method paves the way for deploying a pruned YOLOv5s model for a real-time gesture-command-based HCI to control some applications, such as the VLC media player, Spotify player, etc., using correctly classified gesture commands in real-time scenarios. The average detection speed of our proposed system has reached more than 60 frames per second (fps) in real-time, which meets the perfect requirement in real-time application control.|

Developing an effective, transparent, and privacy-preserving reputation model necessitates on-chain implementation using smart contracts. However, managing task evaluation and reputation updates alongside crowdsourcing transactions on-chain substantially strains system scalability and performance. This paper introduces RollupTheCrowd, a novel blockchain-powered crowdsourcing framework that leverages zkRollups to enhance system scalability while protecting user privacy. Our framework includes an effective and privacy-preserving reputation model that gauges workers' trustworthiness by assessing their crowdsourcing interactions. To alleviate the load on our blockchain, we employ an off-chain storage scheme, optimizing RollupTheCrowd's performance. Utilizing smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs, our Rollup layer achieves a significant 20x reduction in gas consumption. To prove the feasibility of the proposed framework, we developed a proof-of-concept implementation using cutting-edge tools. The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of RollupTheCrowd, validating its potential for real-world application scenarios.|

The results show that despite radial bar charts are the most popular visualization for activity data on smartwatches, the users' preferences might be influenced by their familiarity with these charts. These findings from this survey will be valuable for designers, developers, and researchers who are interested in creating innovative and effective solutions for activity visualization on smartwatches.|

A comprehensive series of systematic experiments were conducted for Reynolds numbers ($Re = U_{\infty} d/\nu$, where $U_{\infty}$ is the fluid velocity, $d$ is the sphere diameter, and $\nu$ is the fluid kinematic viscosity) ranging from $6\times10^4$ to $1.3\times10^5$, and dimple depth ratios ($k/d$, where $k$ is the dimple depth) from $0$ to $1\times10^{-2}$ using a smart morphable sphere with one smooth and one dimpled side. The findings show that an asymmetrically rough sphere can generate lift forces up to 80\% of the drag, comparable to those produced by the Magnus Effect. The dimple depth ratio affects both the $Re$ at which lift generation begins and the maximum lift coefficient ($C_L$) achievable. The optimal $k/d$ for maximum lift varies with $Re$: deeper dimples are needed at low $Re$, while shallower dimples are more effective at high $Re$. For a fixed $Re$, increasing $k/d$ monotonically increases lift until a critical $k/d$ is reached, beyond which lift decreases. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) revealed that dimples delay flow separation on the rough side while the smooth side remains unchanged, resulting in asymmetric boundary layer separation, leading to wake deflection and lift generation. Beyond the critical $k/d$, the flow separation location moved upstream, increasing the size of the rear wake, reducing wake deflection, and thus decreasing lift. Overall, this study establishes the foundation for wake control over bluff bodies and paves the way for real-time manoeuvring applications.|

This contradiction between immutability and the need for modifications has led to the development of upgradeable smart contracts. These contracts are immutable in principle yet upgradable by design, allowing updates without altering the underlying data or state, thus preserving the contract's intent while allowing improvements. This study aims to understand the application and implications of upgradeable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By introducing a dataset that catalogs the versions and evolutionary trajectories of smart contracts, the research explores key dimensions: the prevalence and adoption patterns of upgrade mechanisms, the likelihood and occurrences of contract upgrades, the nature of modifications post-upgrade, and their impact on user engagement and contract activity. Through empirical analysis, this study identifies upgradeable contracts and examines their upgrade history to uncover trends, preferences, and challenges associated with modifications. The evidence from analyzing over 44 million contracts shows that only 3% have upgradeable characteristics, with only 0.34% undergoing upgrades. This finding underscores a cautious approach by developers towards modifications, possibly due to the complexity of upgrade processes or a preference for maintaining stability. Furthermore, the study shows that upgrades are mainly aimed at feature enhancement and vulnerability mitigation, particularly when the contracts' source codes are accessible. However, the relationship between upgrades and user activity is complex, suggesting that additional factors significantly affect the use of smart contracts beyond their evolution.|

We view the effectiveness of Borel summation as a regularity property of the solution, and we show that the solutions of certain differential equation and integration problems are regular in this sense. By taking a geometric perspective on the Laplace and Borel transforms, we also clarify why "Borel regular" solutions are associated with special points on the Borel plane. The particular classes of problems we look at are level 1 ODEs and exponential period integrals over one dimensional Lefschetz thimbles. To expand the variety of examples available in the literature, we treat various examples of these problems in detail.|

We extend previous theoretical work on the topic to handle real-world complications, namely unknown valve characteristics and hysteresis. We generate two datasets in the Smart Water Infrastructure laboratory in Aalborg, Denmark, on which we evaluate the proposed procedure. In the first data set the system is controlled in such a way to excite all operational modes in terms of combinations of valve set-points. Here the best performing model predicted volume flow rates within roughly 5 and 10 \% deviation from the mean volume flow rate for the consumer with the highest and lowest mean volume flow rates respectively. This performance was met in the majority of the operational region. In the second data set, the system was controlled in order to mimic real load curves. The model trained on this data set performed similarly well when evaluated on data in the operational range represented in the training data. However, the model performance deteriorated when evaluated on data which was not represented in the training data.|

ADLs recognition is typically based on deep learning methods requiring large datasets to be trained. Recently, several studies proved that Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively capture common-sense knowledge about human activities. However, the effectiveness of LLMs for ADLs recognition in smart home environments still deserves to be investigated. In this work, we propose ADL-LLM, a novel LLM-based ADLs recognition system. ADLLLM transforms raw sensor data into textual representations, that are processed by an LLM to perform zero-shot ADLs recognition. Moreover, in the scenario where a small labeled dataset is available, ADL-LLM can also be empowered with few-shot prompting. We evaluated ADL-LLM on two public datasets, showing its effectiveness in this domain.|

At its core, it is about building software that is secure in composition with untrusted code, a challenge that extends far beyond blockchains. We introduce SCIF, a language for building smart contracts that are compositionally secure. SCIF is based on the fundamentally compositional principle of secure information flow, but extends this core mechanism to include protection against reentrancy attacks, confused deputy attacks, and improper error handling, even in the presence of malicious contracts that do not follow SCIF's rules. SCIF supports a rich ecosystem of interacting principals with partial trust through its mechanisms for dynamic trust management. SCIF has been implemented as a compiler to Solidity. We describe the SCIF language, including its static checking rules and runtime. Finally, we implement several applications with intricate security reasoning, showing how SCIF supports building complex smart contracts securely and gives programmer accurate diagnostics about potential security bugs.|

The images were methodically collected following standardized methods to assure uniformity and quality. Each image has been labelled and grouped into directories based on binary class labels, which indicate whether each streetlight is functional or not. This organized dataset is intended to make it easier to train and evaluate deep neural networks, allowing for the creation of pre-trained models that have robust feature representations.

Despite this, data trading faces challenges like the absence of robust pricing methods and the lack of trustworthy trading mechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce a traffic-oriented data trading platform named Data on The Move (DTM), integrating traffic simulation, data trading, and Artificial Intelligent (AI) agents. The DTM platform supports evident-based data value evaluation and AI-based trading mechanisms. Leveraging the common sense capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess traffic state and data value, DTM can determine reasonable traffic data pricing through multi-round interaction and simulations. Moreover, DTM provides a pricing method validation by simulating traffic systems, multi-agent interactions, and the heterogeneity and irrational behaviors of individuals in the trading market. Within the DTM platform, entities such as connected vehicles and traffic light controllers could engage in information collecting, data pricing, trading, and decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed AI agent-based pricing approach enhances data trading by offering rational prices, as evidenced by the observed improvement in traffic efficiency. This underscores the effectiveness and practical value of DTM, offering new perspectives for the evolution of data markets and smart cities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study employing LLMs in data pricing and a pioneering data trading practice in the field of intelligent vehicles and smart cities.|

As one of Ethereum's core applications, smart contracts utilize diverse contract codes to meet various functional needs and have gained widespread use. However, the non-tamperability of smart contracts, coupled with vulnerabilities caused by natural flaws or human errors, has brought unprecedented challenges to blockchain security. Therefore, in order to ensure the healthy development of blockchain technology and the stability of the blockchain community, it is particularly important to study the vulnerability detection techniques for smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view Aware Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Framework named DVDet. The framework initially converts the source code and bytecode of smart contracts into weighted graphs and control flow sequences, capturing potential risk features from these two perspectives and integrating them for analysis, ultimately achieving effective contract vulnerability detection. Comprehensive experiments on the Ethereum dataset show that our method outperforms others in detecting vulnerabilities.|

To emulate these in aerial robots weighing less than a gram, known as flying insect robots (FIRs), a fast and responsive control system is essential. To date, these have largely been, at their core, elaborations of proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type feedback control. Without exception, their gains have been painstakingly tuned by hand. Aggressive maneuvers have further required task-specific tuning. Optimal control has the potential to mitigate these issues, but has to date only been demonstrated using approxiate models and receding horizon controllers (RHC) that are too computationally demanding to be carried out onboard the robot. Here we used a more accurate stroke-averaged model of forces and torques to implement the first demonstration of optimal control on an FIR that is computationally efficient enough to be performed by a microprocessor carried onboard. We took force and torque measurements from a 150 mg FIR, the UW Robofly, using a custom-built sensitive force-torque sensor, and validated them using motion capture data in free flight. We demonstrated stable hovering (RMS error of about 4 cm) and trajectory tracking maneuvers at translational velocities up to 25 cm/s using an optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR). These results were enabled by a more accurate model and lay the foundation for future work that uses our improved model and optimal controller in conjunction with recent advances in low-power receding horizon control to perform accurate aggressive maneuvers without iterative, task-specific tuning.|

The service resource allocation is the primary factor that restricts the production time and cost in the cloud manufacturing customized production (CMCP). In order to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost in CMCP, we propose a new framework which considers the collaboration among services with the same functionality. A mathematical evaluation formulation for the service composition and service usage scheme is constructed with the following critical indexes: completion time, cost, and number of selected services. Subsequently, a problem decomposition based genetic algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal service compositions with service usage schemes. A smart clothing customization case is illustrated so as to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the method proposed in this paper. Finally, the results of simulation experiments and comparisons show that these solutions obtained by our method are with the minimum time, a lower cost, and the fewer selected services.|
