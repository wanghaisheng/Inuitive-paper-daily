While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of smart contract governance. This paper presents a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research papers, we develop a governance taxonomy to examine these issues. We collect and analyze 4,446 audit reports from 17 reputable Web3 security companies, categorizing the governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. In addition, we identify vulnerabilities in the governance design and implementation processes, e.g., flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. To aid in the identification of the main topics of governance issues, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Moreover, we explore the challenges associated with maintaining consistency between the code and the whitepaper in DeFi applications, providing valuable insights for addressing this issue in the future. We build a prototype tool based on artificial intelligence (AI), representing an initial attempt to uncover potential solutions. We validate this prototype across eight DeFi projects, achieving a 56.14% F1 score and a 80% recall. Through this study, we expect to assist the design and development teams of DeFi applications, as well as users, researchers, and regulators, in better understanding and addressing governance challenges, thereby fostering the healthy development of DeFi.|

Ethereum plays a pivotal role in facilitating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Understanding information propagation dynamics in Ethereum is crucial for ensuring network efficiency, security, and scalability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to analyze the information propagation patterns in the Ethereum network. The first phase of our research involves data collection from the Ethereum blockchain, consisting of blocks, transactions, and node degrees. We construct a transaction graph representation using adjacency matrices to capture the node embeddings; while our major contribution is to develop a combined Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimize the network efficiency and scalability. It learns the best actions to take in various network states, ultimately leading to improved network efficiency, throughput, and optimize gas limits for block processing. In the experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of our model on a large-scale Ethereum dataset. We investigate effectively aggregating information from neighboring nodes capturing graph structure and updating node embeddings using GCN with the objective of transaction pattern prediction, accounting for varying network loads and number of blocks. Not only we design a gas limit optimization model and provide the algorithm, but also to address scalability, we demonstrate the use and implementation of sparse matrices in GraphConv, GraphSAGE, and GAT. The results indicate that our designed GAT-RL model achieves superior results compared to other GCN models in terms of performance. It effectively propagates information across the network, optimizing gas limits for block processing and improving network efficiency.|

In comparison to existing radar and camera-based sensing systems for vitals monitoring, this technology uses only a low-cost ubiquitous light source (e.g., infrared light emitting diode) and sensor (e.g., photodetector). This light-wave sensing (LWS) system recognizes different breathing anomalies from the variations of light intensity reflected from the chest of the robot within a 0.5m-1.5m range. The anomaly detection model demonstrates up to 96.6% average accuracy in classifying 7 different types of breathing data using machine learning. The model can also detect faulty data collected by the system that does not contain breathing information. The developed system can be utilized at home or healthcare facilities as a smart, non-contact and discreet respiration monitoring method.|

The coupling between light and spins is inherently non-linear, and occurs via multi-photon processes like Raman scattering and two-photon absorption/emission with electronically excited intermediate states. Based on this, two pathways are elucidated: (i) In the absence of external driving, long-range interactions are mediated by the exchange of at least two virtual cavity photons. We show that these vacuum-mediated interactions can surpass local Heisenberg interactions in mesoscopic setups such as sufficiently small split-ring resonators. (ii) In a laser-driven cavity, interactions can be tailored through a hybrid scheme involving both external laser photons and cavity photons. This offers a versatile pathway for Floquet engineering of long-range interactions in macroscopic systems. In general, the derivation of these interactions requires careful consideration: Notably, we demonstrate that a simple phenomenological approach, based on a spin-photon Hamiltonian that captures Raman and two-photon processes with effective matrix elements, can be used only if the cavity is resonantly driven. Outside of these narrow resonant regimes as well as for the undriven case, a fourth-order series expansion within the underlying electronic model is necessary, which we perform to obtain long-range four-spin interactions in the half-filled Hubbard model.|

The experiments were done in quiescent water. The body consists of two interconnected plates hinged at one end with a 'torsion' spring. Initially, a thread loop holds the plates apart at an interplate angle of 60 degrees. Cutting of the thread initiates the clapping motion, and if allowed, the body propels forward a certain distance. Experiments have been performed for three values of $d^*$(= depth/length): 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5. In both cases, vortex loops initially develop along the three edges of each plate, which reconnect by the end of the clapping motion resulting in the formation of an elliptical vortex loop in the wake for $d^*$ = 1.5, 1.0 bodies, and multiple connected rings for $d^*$ = 0.5 bodies. Three main and unexpected differences are observed between the 'Dynamic' and 'Stationary' bodies. In the dynamic case, the clapping action is faster compared to the stationary case, with the maximum angular plate velocity being twice as high. The mean thrust coefficient, $\overline{C_T}$, based on plate tip velocity, is higher for the stationary. The value of $\overline{C_T}$ and the circulation in the starting vortices is almost independent of $d^*$ for the dynamic case, whereas it increases with $d^*$ for the stationary case. The core separation of starting vortices closely matches in both stationary and dynamic cases although circulation varies.|

The excluded volume interactions have been switched off and only the interactions of entropic origin arising from the topological constraints are considered. An interpretation from the polymer point of view of the field equations that minimize the energy of the model in the limit in which one of the spatial dimensions of the 4-plat becomes very large is provided. It is shown that the self-dual contributions are responsible for the long-range interactions that are necessary for preserving the global topological properties of the system during the thermal fluctuations. The non self-dual part is also related to the topological constraints, and takes into account the local interactions acting on the monomers in order to prevent the breaking of the polymer lines. It turns out that the energy landscape of the two linked rings is quite complex. Assuming as a rough approximation that the monomer densities of half of the 4-plat are constant, at least two points of energy minimum are found. Classes of non-trivial self-dual solutions of the self-dual field equations are derived. ... .|

However, the cloud is not an optimal solution. To overcome this issue, fog computing is used to enable processing at the edge while still allowing communication with the cloud. Many applications rely on fog computing, including traffic management. In this paper, an Intelligent Traffic Congestion Mitigation System (ITCMS) is proposed to address traffic congestion in heavily populated smart cities. The proposed system is implemented using fog computing and tested in a crowded city. Its performance is evaluated based on multiple metrics, such as traffic efficiency, energy savings, reduced latency, average traffic flow rate, and waiting time. The obtained results are compared with similar techniques that tackle the same issue. The results obtained indicate that the execution time of the simulation is 4,538 seconds, and the delay in the application loop is 49.67 seconds. The paper addresses various issues, including CPU usage, heap memory usage, throughput, and the total average delay, which are essential for evaluating the performance of the ITCMS. Our system model is also compared with other models to assess its performance. A comparison is made using two parameters, namely throughput and the total average delay, between the ITCMS, IOV (Internet of Vehicle), and STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on LOESS). Consequently, the results confirm that the proposed system outperforms the others in terms of higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved traffic efficiency.|

In the presence of an external magnetic field, the chiral Lagrangian for two flavors is accompanied by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term containing an anomalous coupling of the neutral pion $\pi_0$ to the magnetic field via the chiral anomaly. Due to this term, the ground state is inhomogeneous in the form of either chiral soliton lattice (CSL), an array of solitons in the direction of magnetic field, or domain-wall Skyrmion (DWSk) phase in which Skyrmions supported by $\pi_3[{\rm SU}(2)] \simeq {\mathbb Z}$ appear inside the solitons as topological lumps supported by $\pi_2(S^2) \simeq {\mathbb Z}$ in the effective worldvolume theory of the soliton. In this paper, we determine the phase boundary between the CSL and DWSk phases beyond the single-soliton approximation, within the leading order of chiral perturbation theory. To this end, we explore a domain-wall Skyrmion chain in multiple soliton configurations. First, we construct the effective theory of the CSL by the moduli approximation, and obtain the ${\mathbb C}P^1$ model or O(3) model, gauged by a background electromagnetic gauge field, with two kinds of topological terms coming from the WZW term: one is the topological lump charge in 2+1 dimensional worldvolume and the other is a topological term counting the soliton number. Topological lumps in the 2+1 dimensional worldvolume theory are superconducting rings and their sizes are constrained by the flux quantization condition. The negative energy condition of the lumps yields the phase boundary between the CSL and DWSk phases. We find that a large region inside the CSL is occupied by the DWSk phase, and that the CSL remains metastable in the DWSk phase in the vicinity of the phase boundary.|

Integrating AI into smart glasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity is still challenging when targeting full-day usage for a satisfactory user experience. This paper illustrates the design and implementation of tiny machine-learning algorithms exploiting novel low-power processors to enable prolonged continuous operation in smart glasses. We explore the energy- and latency-efficient of smart glasses in the case of real-time object detection. To this goal, we designed a smart glasses prototype as a research platform featuring two microcontrollers, including a novel milliwatt-power RISC-V parallel processor with a hardware accelerator for visual AI, and a Bluetooth low-power module for communication. The smart glasses integrate power cycling mechanisms, including image and audio sensing interfaces. Furthermore, we developed a family of novel tiny deep-learning models based on YOLO with sub-million parameters customized for microcontroller-based inference dubbed TinyissimoYOLO v1.3, v5, and v8, aiming at benchmarking object detection with smart glasses for energy and latency. Evaluations on the prototype of the smart glasses demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's 17ms inference latency and 1.59mJ energy consumption per inference while ensuring acceptable detection accuracy. Further evaluation reveals an end-to-end latency from image capturing to the algorithm's prediction of 56ms or equivalently 18 fps, with a total power consumption of 62.9mW, equivalent to a 9.3 hours of continuous run time on a 154mAh battery. These results outperform MCUNet (TinyNAS+TinyEngine), which runs a simpler task (image classification) at just 7.3 fps per second.|

The countermeasure against FIA may lead to a vulnerability for SCA when the whole algorithm needs to be masked (in environments like smart cards). This led to a variant of the LCD and LCP problems, where several results have been obtained intensively for LCD codes, but only partial results have been derived for LCP codes. Given the gap between the thin results and their particular importance, this paper aims to reduce this by further studying the LCP of codes in special code families and, precisely, the characterisation and construction mechanism of LCP codes of algebraic geometry codes over finite fields. Notably, we propose constructing explicit LCP of codes from elliptic curves. Besides, we also study the security parameters of the derived LCP of codes $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$ (notably for cyclic codes), which are given by the minimum distances $d(\mathcal{C})$ and $d(\mathcal{D}^\perp)$. Further, we show that for LCP algebraic geometry codes $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$, the dual code $\mathcal{C}^\perp$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{D}$ under some specific conditions we exhibit. Finally, we investigate whether MDS LCP of algebraic geometry codes exist (MDS codes are among the most important in coding theory due to their theoretical significance and practical interests). Construction schemes for obtaining LCD codes from any algebraic curve were given in 2018 by Mesnager, Tang and Qi in [``Complementary dual algebraic geometry codes", IEEE Trans. Inform Theory, vol. 64(4), 2390--3297, 2018]. To our knowledge, it is the first time LCP of algebraic geometry codes has been studied.|

However, when a single video frame becomes the input, these works usually fail to address degradations caused by video compression, such as mosquito noise, ringing, blockiness, and staircase noise. In this work, we for the first time, present a video compression-based degradation model to synthesize low-resolution image data in the blind SISR task. Our proposed image synthesizing method is widely applicable to existing image datasets, so that a single degraded image can contain distortions caused by the lossy video compression algorithms. This overcomes the leak of feature diversity in video data and thus retains the training efficiency. By introducing video coding artifacts to SISR degradation models, neural networks can super-resolve images with the ability to restore video compression degradations, and achieve better results on restoring generic distortions caused by image compression as well. Our proposed approach achieves superior performance in SOTA no-reference Image Quality Assessment, and shows better visual quality on various datasets. In addition, we evaluate the SISR neural network trained with our degradation model on video super-resolution (VSR) datasets. Compared to architectures specifically designed for the VSR purpose, our method exhibits similar or better performance, evidencing that the presented strategy on infusing video-based degradation is generalizable to address more complicated compression artifacts even without temporal cues.|

In recent years, video instance segmentation, which aims to track and segment multiple objects in video frames, has drawn much attention for its potential applications in various emerging areas such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and smart retail. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for instance-level visual analysis on video frames, which can simultaneously conduct object detection, instance segmentation, and multi-object tracking. The core idea of our method is collaborative multi-task learning which is achieved by a novel structure, named associative connections among detection, segmentation, and tracking task heads in an end-to-end learnable CNN. These additional connections allow information propagation across multiple related tasks, so as to benefit these tasks simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed method extensively on KITTI MOTS and MOTS Challenge datasets and obtain quite encouraging results.|

Our investigation is focused on various bulk observables, which include charged particle multiplicity ($N_{\text{ch}}$), average transverse momentum ($\langle p_{\text{T}}\rangle$), initial eccentricity ($\epsilon_{n}$), and flow harmonics ($v_{n}$), for different orientations of U+U collisions within the range of $0^{\circ} < \theta < 120 ^{\circ}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm NN}} = 2.12$ GeV ($p_{\mathrm lab}$ = 500 MeV). Among the various collision configurations at this energy, the tip-tip scenario emerged with the highest average charged particle multiplicity, denoted as $\langle N_{\text{ch}} \rangle$. Notably, both the second and third-order eccentricities, $\epsilon_{2,3}$, revealed intricate patterns as they varied with impact parameter across distinct configurations. The tip-tip configuration displayed the most pronounced magnitude of rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_{1}$), whereas the body-body configuration exhibited the least pronounced magnitude. Concerning elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) near mid-rapidity ($\eta < 1.0$), a negative sign is observed for all configurations except for the side-side exhibited a distinctly positive sign. Within the spectrum of configurations, the body-body scenario displayed the highest magnitude of $v_{2}$. For reaction plane correlated triangular flow ($v_{3}$), the body-body configuration emerged with the largest magnitude while the side-side exhibited the smallest magnitude. Our study seeks to establish a fundamental understanding of various U+U collision configurations in preparation for the forthcoming CEE experiment.|

This model is designed for studies of carbon nanostructure synthesis such as carbon black and graphene flakes, including soot growth kinetics. Methane pyrolysis with carbon nanostructure synthesis is a two-stage process where conversion of CH4 to C2H2 precedes the growth of PAH molecules from acetylene. We present a single chemical mechanism that accurately describes both stages. We have constructed a compact and accurate chemical mechanism capable of modeling both stages of methane pyrolysis based on the ABF mechanism which was expanded with most prominent reaction pathways from the mechanism by Tao for small PAH molecules and HACA pathways for larger PAH molecules, up to 37 aromatic rings. The resulting mechanism was validated through comparison to multiple available sets of experimental data. Good agreement with the experimental data for both processes was obtained. Performance of the mechanism was tested for pyrolysis of methane-rich mixtures under long residence times leading to abundant formation of PAH molecules. It is shown that the inclusion of larger PAH species (up to A37) in the chemical mechanism is important for accurate prediction of the fraction of carbon converted to PAH molecules and, correspondingly, residual fraction of acetylene in the mixture.|

Specifically, it introduces the differentiated retraction and an approximation of the Cayley transform to the differentiated matrix exponential. These vector transports are demonstrated to satisfy the Ring-Wirth non-expansive condition under non-standard metrics while preserving isometry. Building upon the novel vector transport operators, we extend the modified Polak-Ribi$\acute{e}$re-Polyak (PRP) conjugate gradient method to the generalized Stiefel manifold. Under a non-monotone line search condition, we prove our algorithm globally converges to a stationary point. The efficiency of the proposed vector transport operators is empirically validated through numerical experiments involving generalized eigenvalue problems and canonical correlation analysis.|

We conduct a survey across 12 agronomists to understand these networking requirements of farm workloads and perform extensive measurements of WiFi 6 performance in a farm to identify the challenges in meeting them. Our measurements reveal how network capacity is fundamentally limited in such a setting, with severe degradation in network performance due to crop canopy, and spotlight farm networks as an emerging new problem domain that can benefit from smarter network resource management decisions. To that end, we design Cornet, a network for supporting on-farm applications that comprises: (i) a multi-hop mesh of WiFi routers that uses a strategic combination of 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands as informed by our measurements, and (ii) a centralized traffic engineering (TE) system that uses a novel abstraction of resource units to reason about wireless network capacity and make TE decisions (schedule flows, assign flow rates, and select routes and channels). Our evaluation, using testbeds in a farm and trace-driven simulations, shows how Cornet achieves 1.4 $\times$ higher network utilization and better meets application demands, compared to standard wireless mesh strategies.|

SAGE integrates information about user preferences, device states, and external factors (such as weather and TV schedules) through the orchestration of a collection of tools. SAGE's capabilities include learning user preferences from natural-language utterances, interacting with devices by reading their API documentation, writing code to continuously monitor devices, and understanding natural device references. To evaluate SAGE, we develop a benchmark of 43 highly challenging smart home tasks, where SAGE successfully achieves 23 tasks, significantly outperforming existing LLM-enabled baselines (5/43).|

Noise not only influences the working efficiency but also the human's health. The problem of reducing noise is one of great importance and great difficulty. The problem has been addressed in many ways over the years. The current methods for noise reducing mostly rely on the materials and transmission medium, which are only effective to some extent for the high frequency noise. However, the effective reduction noise method especially for low frequency noise is very limited.   Here we come up with a noise reduction system consist of a sensor to detect the noise in the environment. Then the noise will be sent to an electronic control system to process the noise, which will generate a reverse phase frequency signal to counteract the disturbance. Finally, the processed smaller noise will be broadcasted by the speaker. Through this smart noise reduction system, even the noise with low-frequency can be eliminated.   The system is also integrated with sleep tracking and music player applications. It can also remember and store settings for the same environment, sense temperature, and smart control of home furniture, fire alarm, etc. This smart system can transfer data easily by Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and controlled by its APP.   In this project, we will present a model of the above technology which can be used in various environments to prevent noise pollution and provide a solution to the people who have difficulties finding a peaceful and quiet environment for sleep, work or study.|

In both cases, we find a one-sorted language in which the theory of the valued field is model complete, if the theory of the residue field is model complete in the language of rings.|

In response, researchers have developed various tools and techniques to identify and prevent vulnerabilities in smart contracts. In this survey, we present a systematic overview of the quality assurance of smart contracts, covering vulnerabilities, attacks, defenses, and tool support. By classifying vulnerabilities based on known attacks, we can identify patterns and common weaknesses that need to be addressed. Moreover, in order to effectively protect smart contracts, we have created a labeled dataset to evaluate various vulnerability detection tools and compare their effectiveness.|

We introduce a general form of the classically studied trace map that unifies several notions from the literature. We develop a theory around these objects and use it to provide a broad extension of a result of Lindo calculating the center of $\operatorname{End}_R(M)$. As a consequence, we show under mild hypotheses that in dimension $1$, the canonical module of $Z(\operatorname{End}_R(M))$ may be calculated as the trace submodule of $M$ with respect to the canonical module of $R$.|

Steiman-Cameron et.al.|[2311.00175v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00175v1)|null|During early phases of a protoplanetary disks's life, gravitational instabilities can produce significant mass transport, can dramatically alter disk structure, can mix and shock-process gas and solids, and may be instrumental in planet formation. We present a 3D grid-based radiative hydrodynamics study with varied resolutions of a 0.07 M$_\odot$ disk orbiting a 0.5 M$_\odot$ star as it settles over most of its radial extent into a quasi-steady asymptotic state that maintains approximate balance between heating produced by GIs and radiative cooling governed by realistic dust opacities. We assess disk stability criteria, thermodynamic properties, strengths of GIs, characteristics of density waves and torques produced by GIs, radial mass transport arising from these torques, and the level to which transport can be represented as local or nonlocal processes. Physical and thermal processes display distinct differences between inner optically thick and outer optically thin regions of the disk. In the inner region, gravitational torques are dominated by low-order Fourier components of the azimuthal mass distribution. These torques are strongly variable on the local dynamical time and are subject to rapid flaring presumably driven by recurrent swing amplification. In the outer region, m=1 torques dominate. Ring-like structures exhibiting strong noncircular motions, and vortices develop near the inner edge between 8 and 14 au. We find that GI-induced spiral modes erupt in a chaotic manner over the whole low-Q part of the disk, with many spiral modes appearing and disappearing, producing gravitoturbulence, but dominated by fluctuating large-scale modes, very different from a simple $\alpha$-disk.|

Altman et.al.|[2311.00170v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00170v1)|null|Coupled learning is a contrastive scheme for tuning the properties of individual elements within a network in order to achieve desired functionality of the system. It takes advantage of physics both to learn using local rules and to "compute" the output response to input data, thus enabling the system to perform decentralized computation without the need for a processor or external memory. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept mechanical network that can learn simple tasks such as self-symmetrizing via iterative tuning of individual spring rest lengths. These mechanical networks could feasibly be scaled and automated to solve increasingly complex tasks, hinting at a new class of "smart" metamaterials.|

More precisely, we extend the definition of parahoric (Dieudonn\'e) $(\mathcal{G}, \mu)$-displays given by Pappas to not necessarily $p$-torsionfree base rings and also introduce the notion of an $(m, n)$-truncated $(\mathcal{G}, \mu)$-display. Then we study the deformation theory of Dieudonn\'e $(\mathcal{G}, \mu)$-displays.   As an application we realize the EKOR stratification of the special fiber of a Kisin-Pappas integral Shimura variety of Hodge type as the fibers of a smooth morphism into the algebraic stack of $(2, 1\text{-}\mathrm{rdt})$-truncated $(\mathcal{G}, \mu)$-displays.|
