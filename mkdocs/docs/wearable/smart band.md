|**2023-11-02**|**A Comprehensive Study of Governance Issues in Decentralized Finance Applications**|Wei Ma et.al.|[2311.01433v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01433v1)|null|Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a prominent application of smart contracts, representing a novel financial paradigm in contrast to centralized finance. While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of smart contract governance. This paper presents a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research papers, we develop a governance taxonomy to examine these issues. We collect and analyze 4,446 audit reports from 17 reputable Web3 security companies, categorizing the governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. In addition, we identify vulnerabilities in the governance design and implementation processes, e.g., flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. To aid in the identification of the main topics of governance issues, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Moreover, we explore the challenges associated with maintaining consistency between the code and the whitepaper in DeFi applications, providing valuable insights for addressing this issue in the future. We build a prototype tool based on artificial intelligence (AI), representing an initial attempt to uncover potential solutions. We validate this prototype across eight DeFi projects, achieving a 56.14% F1 score and a 80% recall. Through this study, we expect to assist the design and development teams of DeFi applications, as well as users, researchers, and regulators, in better understanding and addressing governance challenges, thereby fostering the healthy development of DeFi.|

Bejas et.al.|[2311.01413v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01413v1)|null|The essential building blocks of cuprate superconductors are two-dimensional CuO$_2$ sheets interspersed with charge reservoir layers. In bilayer cuprates, two closely spaced CuO$_2$ sheets are separated by a larger distance from the subsequent pair in the next unit cell. In contrast to single-layer cuprates, prior theoretical work on bilayer systems has predicted two distinct acoustic plasmon bands for a given out-of-plane momentum transfer. Here we report random phase approximation (RPA) calculations for bilayer systems which corroborate the existence of two distinct plasmons bands. We find that the intensity of the lower-energy band is negligibly small, whereas the higher-energy band carries significant spectral weight. We also present resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments at the O $K$-edge on the bilayer cuprate Y$_{0.85}$Ca$_{0.15}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (Ca-YBCO), which show only one dispersive plasmon branch, in agreement with the RPA calculations. In addition, the RPA results indicate that the dispersion of the higher-energy plasmon band in Ca-YBCO is not strictly acoustic, but exhibits a substantial energy gap of approximately 250 meV at the two-dimensional Brillouin zone center.|

Ethereum plays a pivotal role in facilitating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Understanding information propagation dynamics in Ethereum is crucial for ensuring network efficiency, security, and scalability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to analyze the information propagation patterns in the Ethereum network. The first phase of our research involves data collection from the Ethereum blockchain, consisting of blocks, transactions, and node degrees. We construct a transaction graph representation using adjacency matrices to capture the node embeddings; while our major contribution is to develop a combined Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimize the network efficiency and scalability. It learns the best actions to take in various network states, ultimately leading to improved network efficiency, throughput, and optimize gas limits for block processing. In the experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of our model on a large-scale Ethereum dataset. We investigate effectively aggregating information from neighboring nodes capturing graph structure and updating node embeddings using GCN with the objective of transaction pattern prediction, accounting for varying network loads and number of blocks. Not only we design a gas limit optimization model and provide the algorithm, but also to address scalability, we demonstrate the use and implementation of sparse matrices in GraphConv, GraphSAGE, and GAT. The results indicate that our designed GAT-RL model achieves superior results compared to other GCN models in terms of performance. It effectively propagates information across the network, optimizing gas limits for block processing and improving network efficiency.|

Bowes et.al.|[2311.01376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01376v1)|null|We propose polarization of scattered optical light from intermediate Galactic latitude infrared cirrus as a new diagnostic to constrain models of interstellar dust and the anisotropic interstellar radiation field (aISRF). For single scattering by a sphere, with Mie scattering phase functions for intensity and polarized intensity for a dust model at a given wavelength (Sloan $r$ and $g$ bands), and with models of anisotropic illumination from the entire sky (represented in HEALPix), we develop the formalism for calculating useful summary parameters for an integrated flux nebula (IFN): average of the phase function weighted by the illumination, polarization angle ($\psi$), and polarization fraction ($p$). To demonstrate the diagnostic discrimination of polarization from scattered light, we report on the effects of different anisotropic illumination models and different dust models on the summary parameters for the Spider IFN. The summary parameters are also sensitive to the IFN location, as we illustrate using FRaNKIE illumination models. For assessing the viability of dust and aISRF models, we find that observations of $\psi$ and $p$ of scattered light are indeed powerful new diagnostics to complement joint modeling of the intensity of scattered light (related to the average phase function) and the intensity of thermal dust emission. However, optically thin IFNs that can be modelled using single scattering are faint and $p$ is not large, as it could be with Rayleigh scattering, and so these observations need to be carried out with care and precision. Results for the Draco nebula compared to the Spider illustrate the challenge.|

In comparison to existing radar and camera-based sensing systems for vitals monitoring, this technology uses only a low-cost ubiquitous light source (e.g., infrared light emitting diode) and sensor (e.g., photodetector). This light-wave sensing (LWS) system recognizes different breathing anomalies from the variations of light intensity reflected from the chest of the robot within a 0.5m-1.5m range. The anomaly detection model demonstrates up to 96.6% average accuracy in classifying 7 different types of breathing data using machine learning. The model can also detect faulty data collected by the system that does not contain breathing information. The developed system can be utilized at home or healthcare facilities as a smart, non-contact and discreet respiration monitoring method.|

Despite the advantages, previous beamforming schemes incur significant losses during beam scanning, particularly when hybrid beamforming is not employed. Consequently, this paper introduces an algorithm capable of compensating for these losses by increasing the power, for this, the algorithm will activate radiating elements required to address a specific Effective Isotropic Radiated Power for a beam pattern over Earth, projected from a GeoStationary satellite. In addition to the aforementioned compensation, other beam parameters have been addressed in the algorithm, such as beamwidth and Side Lobe Levels. To achieve these objectives, we propose employing the array thinning concept through the use of genetic algorithms, which enable beam shaping with the desired characteristics and power. The full array design considers an open-ended waveguide, configured to operate in circular polarization within the Ka-band frequency range of 17.7-20.2 GHz.|

Traditional SatCom systems struggle with efficient resource management due to static multibeam configurations, hindering quality of service (QoS) amidst dynamic traffic demands. This paper introduces an innovative solution - real-time adaptive beamforming on multibeam satellites with software-defined payloads in geostationary orbit (GEO). Utilizing a Direct Radiating Array (DRA) with circular polarization in the 17.7 - 20.2 GHz band, the paper outlines DRA design and a supervised learning-based algorithm for on-board beamforming. This adaptive approach not only meets precise beam projection needs but also dynamically adjusts beamwidth, minimizes sidelobe levels (SLL), and optimizes effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP).|

Utilizing these structural and electronic properties, we investigate ultrafast electron dynamics and high harmonic generation (HHG) from phosphorene subject to band structure engineering through external strain, based on ab initio time-dependent density-functional theory approach. We show that strong field processes in such systems can be optimized and controlled by biaxial tensile and compressive strain engineering, that results in electronic structure modification. While -10% strain resulted in closing of band gap, 2% strain increased the gap by 22% with respect to 0.9 eV in pristine phosphorene, consequently affecting the high harmonic yield. With reduction of gap, by applying strain from 2% to -10%, the valence band near $\Gamma-$point becomes more flat and discreet, resulting in large electronic density of states and enhanced electronic excitation, which reflects in their ultrafast sub-cycle dynamics under laser excitation. Moreover, due to its intrinsic in-plane anisotropy, harmonic yield with laser polarization along the armchair (AC) direction is found to be higher than that of the zigzag (ZZ) direction for all the strain cases. Nearly, an order of magnitude enhancement of harmonic intensity is achieved for -10% strain along AC direction. The current study expands the research possibilities of phosphorene into a previously unexplored domain, indicating its potential for future utilization in extreme-ultraviolet and attosecond nanophotonics, and also for efficient table-top HHG sources.|

Long-term video-EEG monitoring was conducted in 51 patients with focal epilepsy, 13 patients with generalized epilepsy, and 9 patients without epilepsy. Slow wave sleep segments were manually marked in the EEG and duration as well as EEG power spectra were extracted. Depressive symptoms were documented with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). At least mild depressive symptoms (BDI>9) were found among 23 patients with focal epilepsy, 5 patients with generalised epilepsy, and 6 patients who had no epilepsy diagnosis. Slow wave sleep duration was shorter for patients with at least mild depressive symptoms (p=.004), independently from epilepsy diagnosis, antiseizure medication, age, and sex. Psychoactive medication was associated with longer slow wave sleep duration (p=.008). Frontal sigma band power (13-15 Hz) during slow wave sleep was higher for patients without epilepsy and without depressive symptoms as compared to patients without depressive symptoms but with focal epilepsy (p=.005). Depressive symptoms affect slow wave sleep duration of patients with epilepsy similarly as in patients without epilepsy. Since reduced slow wave sleep can increase the likelihood of seizure occurrence, these results stress the importance of adequate treatment for patients with epilepsy who experience depressive symptoms.|

The former is the dominant effect in the cuprate superconductors or heavy fermion systems while the latter in twisted bilayer graphene or geometrically frustrated metals. However, the simultaneous cooperation of both effects in the same quantum material--the design principle to produce a correlated topological flat bands pinned at the Fermi level--remains rare. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report the observation of a flat band at the Fermi level in a 3$d$ pyrochlore metal CuV$_2$S$_4$. From a combination of first-principles calculations and slave-spin calculations, we understand the origin of this band to be a destructive quantum-interference effect associated with the V pyrochlore sublattice and further renormalization to the Fermi level by electron interactions in the partially filled V $t_{2g}$ orbitals. As a result, we find transport behavior that indicates a deviation from Fermi-liquid behavior as well as a large Sommerfeld coefficient. Our work demonstrates the pathway into correlated topology by constructing and pinning correlated flat bands near the Fermi level out of a pure $d$-electron system by the combined cooperation of local Coulomb interactions and geometric frustration in a pyrochlore lattice system.|

We demonstrate that free electrons in a vacuum can also emit highly directional monochromatic waves when they are in close proximity to a medium that is periodically modulated temporally, suggesting the existence of temporal Smith-Purcell effect. The momentum band gaps of time-varying media, such as photonic time crystals (PTCs), create new pathways for the injection of external energy, allowing the frequency, intensity, and spatial distribution of the electromagnetic fields to be controlled. Moreover, the PTC substrate enables the conversion of localized evanescent fields into amplified, highly directional propagating plane waves that are only sensitive to the velocity of particles and the modulation frequency, which allows us to observe and utilize Cerenkov-like radiation in free space. Our work exhibits significant opportunities for the utilization of time-varying structures in various fields, including particle identification, ultraweak signal detection, and improved radiation source design.|

However, the cloud is not an optimal solution. To overcome this issue, fog computing is used to enable processing at the edge while still allowing communication with the cloud. Many applications rely on fog computing, including traffic management. In this paper, an Intelligent Traffic Congestion Mitigation System (ITCMS) is proposed to address traffic congestion in heavily populated smart cities. The proposed system is implemented using fog computing and tested in a crowded city. Its performance is evaluated based on multiple metrics, such as traffic efficiency, energy savings, reduced latency, average traffic flow rate, and waiting time. The obtained results are compared with similar techniques that tackle the same issue. The results obtained indicate that the execution time of the simulation is 4,538 seconds, and the delay in the application loop is 49.67 seconds. The paper addresses various issues, including CPU usage, heap memory usage, throughput, and the total average delay, which are essential for evaluating the performance of the ITCMS. Our system model is also compared with other models to assess its performance. A comparison is made using two parameters, namely throughput and the total average delay, between the ITCMS, IOV (Internet of Vehicle), and STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on LOESS). Consequently, the results confirm that the proposed system outperforms the others in terms of higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved traffic efficiency.|

Spectral analysis in the non-flaring segment of the observation revealed that the equivalent width of the iron fluorescence emission is correlated with the observed absorption column density and the ratio of the iron K$\beta$ and K$\alpha$ line strength varied with the flux of the source. Coherent pulsations were detected with the spin period of the pulsar of 687.9$\pm$0.1 s, and a secondary pulsation was also detected with a period of 671.8$\pm$0.2 s, most prominent in the energy band of the iron line. At the spin period of the neutron star, the pulsation of the iron line has a low amplitude and the profile is different from the continuum. Pulse phase-resolved spectroscopy also revealed pulsations of the iron emission line during the non-flaring segment of the light curve. At the secondary period, both the iron line and the continuum have nearly identical pulse fraction and pulse profile. The additional periodicity can be attributed to the beat frequency between the spin of the neutron star and the Keplerian frequency of a stellar wind clump in retrograde motion around the neutron star. Reprocessed X-ray emissions originating from the clump can produce the observed secondary pulsations both in the continuum and the iron fluorescence line. The clump rotating around the neutron star is estimated to be approximately five lt-s away from the neutron star.|

Pasquini et.al.|[2311.01163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01163v1)|null|[Abridged] JWST observations of the Orion Bar have shown the incredible richness of PAH bands and their variation on small scales. We aim to probe the photochemical evolution of PAHs across the key zones of the photodissociation region (PDR) that is the Orion Bar using unsupervised machine learning. We use NIRSpec and MIRI IFU data from the JWST ERS Program PDRs4All. We lever bisecting k-means clustering to generate detailed spatial maps of the spectral variability in several wavelength regions. We discuss the variations in the cluster profiles and connect them to the local physical conditions. We interpret these variations with respect to the key zones: the HII region, the atomic PDR zone, and the three dissociation fronts. The PAH emission exhibits spectral variation that depends strongly on spatial position in the PDR. We find the 8.6um band to behave differently than all other bands which vary systematically with one another. We find uniform variation in the 3.4-3.6um bands and 3.4/3.3 intensity ratio. We attribute the carrier of the 3.4-3.6um bands to a single side group attached to very similarly sized PAHs. Cluster profiles reveal a transition between characteristic profiles classes of the 11.2um feature from the atomic to the molecular PDR zone. We find the carriers of each of the profile classes to be independent, and reason the latter to be PAH clusters existing solely deep in the molecular PDR. Clustering also reveals a connection between the 11.2 and 6.2um bands; and that clusters generated from variation in the 10.9-11.63um region can be used to recover those in the 5.95-6.6um region. Clustering is a powerful tool for characterizing PAH variability on both spatial and spectral scales. For individual bands as well as global spectral behaviours, we find UV-processing to be the most important driver of the evolution of PAHs and their spectral signatures in the Orion Bar.|

Blazar AO 0235+164, located at redshift z = 0.94, has undergone several sharp multi-spectral-range flaring episodes during the last decades. In particular, the episodes peaking in 2008 and 2015, that received extensive multi-wavelength coverage, exhibited interesting behavior.   Aims. We study the actual origin of these two observed flares by constraining the properties of the observed photo-polarimetric variability, those of the broad-band spectral energy-distribution and the observed time-evolution behavior of the source as seen by ultra-high resolution total-flux and polarimetric Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging.   Methods. The analysis of VLBI images allows us to constrain kinematic and geometrical parameters of the 7 mm jet. We use the Discrete Correlation Function to compute the statistical correlation and the delays between emission at different spectral ranges. Multi-epoch modeling of the spectral energy distributions allows us to propose specific models of emission; in particular for the unusual spectral features observed in this source in the X-ray region of the spectrum during strong multi spectral-range flares.   Results. We find that these X-ray spectral features can be explained by an emission component originating in a separate particle distribution than the one responsible for the two standard blazar bumps. This is in agreement with the results of our correlation analysis that do not find a strong correlation between the X-rays and the remaining spectral ranges. We find that both external Compton dominated and synchrotron self-Compton dominated models can explain the observed spectral energy distributions. However, synchrotron self-Compton models are strongly favored by the delays and geometrical parameters inferred from the observations.|

The operators use dedicated frequency bands, but each RIS inadvertently reflects the transmitted uplink signals of the user equipment devices in multiple bands. Consequently, the concurrent reflection of pilot signals during the channel estimation phase introduces a new inter-operator pilot contamination effect. We investigate the implications of this effect in systems with either deterministic or correlated Rayleigh fading channels, specifically focusing on its impact on channel estimation quality, signal equalization, and channel capacity. The numerical results demonstrate the substantial degradation in system performance caused by this phenomenon and highlight the pressing need to address inter-operator pilot contamination in multi-operator RIS deployments. To combat the negative effect of this new type of pilot contamination, we propose to use orthogonal RIS configurations during uplink pilot transmission, which can mitigate or eliminate the negative effect of inter-operator pilot contamination at the expense of some inter-operator information exchange and orchestration.|

We found characteristic monochromatic radio powers of $P_\mathrm{char}=(2-13) \times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, $P_\mathrm{char}=2\times10^{24}-1.3\times10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, indicating that AGN-related radio emission is widespread in the sample. The signal-to-noise ratios of the redshift-binned median stacked maps are between $4-6$, and we expect that with the inclusion of the yet to be completed third-epoch VLASS observations, the detection limit defined as signal-to-noise ratio $\mathrm{SNR}\ge6$ could be reached, and the redshift dependence can be determined. To obtain information on the general spectral properties of the faint radio emission in high-redshift AGNs, we confined the sample to $\sim3000$ objects covered by both the VLASS and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey. We found that the flux densities from the median stacked maps show a characteristic spectral index of $\alpha^*=-0.30\pm0.15$, which is in agreement with the median spectral index of the radio-detected $z\ge4$ AGNs from our high-redshift AGN catalogue. The three-band mid-infrared colour--colour diagram based on Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer observations provides further support regarding the AGN contribution to the radio emission in the sub-mJy sample.|

Integrating AI into smart glasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity is still challenging when targeting full-day usage for a satisfactory user experience. This paper illustrates the design and implementation of tiny machine-learning algorithms exploiting novel low-power processors to enable prolonged continuous operation in smart glasses. We explore the energy- and latency-efficient of smart glasses in the case of real-time object detection. To this goal, we designed a smart glasses prototype as a research platform featuring two microcontrollers, including a novel milliwatt-power RISC-V parallel processor with a hardware accelerator for visual AI, and a Bluetooth low-power module for communication. The smart glasses integrate power cycling mechanisms, including image and audio sensing interfaces. Furthermore, we developed a family of novel tiny deep-learning models based on YOLO with sub-million parameters customized for microcontroller-based inference dubbed TinyissimoYOLO v1.3, v5, and v8, aiming at benchmarking object detection with smart glasses for energy and latency. Evaluations on the prototype of the smart glasses demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's 17ms inference latency and 1.59mJ energy consumption per inference while ensuring acceptable detection accuracy. Further evaluation reveals an end-to-end latency from image capturing to the algorithm's prediction of 56ms or equivalently 18 fps, with a total power consumption of 62.9mW, equivalent to a 9.3 hours of continuous run time on a 154mAh battery. These results outperform MCUNet (TinyNAS+TinyEngine), which runs a simpler task (image classification) at just 7.3 fps per second.|

Researchers also target the development of flexible 6G non-terrestrial access architectures.

The transition from even- to odd-parity superconducting phase is supported by the P4/nmm crystal structure and it can be induced by the external magnetic field. Dual nature of the Ce $f$ electrons and competition between their itinerant and localized nature can be important for its physical proprieties. The existing electronic band structure in this material is still under debate. Energy scale occurring in the system can be important for adequate theoretical description of its supercomputing properties. In this paper, we discuss electronic band structure obtained from {\it ab initio} calculations. We analyze electronic surface states which can be compared with recently obtained angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurement (ARPES). Additionally, we present the analyses of the hopping parameters obtained from the electronic band structure. The As-Rh layers are characterized by much more significant hopping parameters between atoms than these obtained for the Ce-Ce atoms. This suggests need of a revision of the tight binding model necessary for adequate description of the physical properties of CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$.|

In this work, we explore a prototype of such a twisted 2D system, artificially stacked twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), where we probe the changes in the interlayer interactions and electron-phonon scattering pathways as the twist angle is varied from 0{\deg} to 30{\deg}, using Raman spectroscopy. The long range Moir\'e potential of the superlattice gives rise to additional intravalley and intervalley scattering of the electrons in TBLG which have been investigated through their Raman signatures. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the electronic band structure of the TBLG superlattices was found to be in agreement with the resonant Raman excitations across the van Hove singularities in the valence and conduction bands predicted for TBLG due to hybridization of bands from the two layers. We also observe that the relative rotation between the graphene layers has a marked influence on the second order overtone and combination Raman modes signalling a commensurate-incommensurate transition in TBLG as the twist angle increases. This serves as a convenient and rapid characterization tool to determine the degree of commensurability in TBLG systems.|

The countermeasure against FIA may lead to a vulnerability for SCA when the whole algorithm needs to be masked (in environments like smart cards). This led to a variant of the LCD and LCP problems, where several results have been obtained intensively for LCD codes, but only partial results have been derived for LCP codes. Given the gap between the thin results and their particular importance, this paper aims to reduce this by further studying the LCP of codes in special code families and, precisely, the characterisation and construction mechanism of LCP codes of algebraic geometry codes over finite fields. Notably, we propose constructing explicit LCP of codes from elliptic curves. Besides, we also study the security parameters of the derived LCP of codes $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$ (notably for cyclic codes), which are given by the minimum distances $d(\mathcal{C})$ and $d(\mathcal{D}^\perp)$. Further, we show that for LCP algebraic geometry codes $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$, the dual code $\mathcal{C}^\perp$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{D}$ under some specific conditions we exhibit. Finally, we investigate whether MDS LCP of algebraic geometry codes exist (MDS codes are among the most important in coding theory due to their theoretical significance and practical interests). Construction schemes for obtaining LCD codes from any algebraic curve were given in 2018 by Mesnager, Tang and Qi in [``Complementary dual algebraic geometry codes", IEEE Trans. Inform Theory, vol. 64(4), 2390--3297, 2018]. To our knowledge, it is the first time LCP of algebraic geometry codes has been studied.|

In recent years, video instance segmentation, which aims to track and segment multiple objects in video frames, has drawn much attention for its potential applications in various emerging areas such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and smart retail. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for instance-level visual analysis on video frames, which can simultaneously conduct object detection, instance segmentation, and multi-object tracking. The core idea of our method is collaborative multi-task learning which is achieved by a novel structure, named associative connections among detection, segmentation, and tracking task heads in an end-to-end learnable CNN. These additional connections allow information propagation across multiple related tasks, so as to benefit these tasks simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed method extensively on KITTI MOTS and MOTS Challenge datasets and obtain quite encouraging results.|

Due to its high bandwidth, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is seen to be frequently exploited in WSNs to facilitate the deployment of bandwidth-demanding applications. However, the vulnerability of mmWave to user mobility typically results in link blockage and thus postponed real-time communications. In this paper, joint sampling and uploading scheduling in an AoI-oriented WSN working in mmWave band is considered, where a single human blocker is moving randomly and signal propagation paths may be blocked. The locations of signal reflectors and the real-time position of the blocker can be detected via wireless sensing technologies. With the knowledge of blocker motion pattern, the statistics of future wireless channels can be predicted. As a result, the AoI degradation arising from link blockage can be forecast and mitigated. Specifically, we formulate the long-term sampling, uplink transmission time and power allocation as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with discounted cost. Due to the curse of dimensionality, the optimal solution is infeasible. A novel low-complexity solution framework with guaranteed performance in the worst case is proposed where the forecast of link blockage is exploited in a value function approximation. Simulations show that compared with several heuristic benchmarks, our proposed policy, benefiting from the awareness of link blockage, can reduce average cost up to 49.6%.|

Conway et.al.|[2311.00916v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00916v1)|null|Floquet engineering provides an optical means to manipulate electronic bandstructures, however, carriers excited by the pump field can lead to an effective heating, and can obscure measurement of the band changes. A recent demonstration of the effects of Floquet engineering on a coherent ensemble of excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ proved particularly sensitive to non-adiabatic effects, while still being able to accurately resolve bandstructure changes. Here, we drive an AC-Stark effect in monolayer WS$_2$ using pulses with constant fluence but varying pulse duration (from 25-235~fs). With shorter pump pulses, the corresponding increase in peak intensity introduces additional carriers via two-photon absorption, leading to additional decoherence and peak broadening (which makes it difficult to resolve the AC-Stark shift). We use multidimensional coherent spectroscopy to create a coherent ensemble of excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ and measure the evolution of the coherence throughout the duration of the Floquet pump pulse. Changes to the amplitude of the macroscopic coherence quantifies the additional broadening. At the same time, the evolution of the average phase allows the instantaneous changes to the bandstructure to be quantified, and is not impacted by the additional broadening. This approach to measuring the evolution of Floquet-Bloch states demonstrates a means to quantify effective heating and non-adiabaticity caused by excited carriers, while at the same time resolving the coherent evolution of the bandstructure.|

Here, through first-principles calculations and model analysis, we demonstrate that monolayer Cr$_2$COOH MXene is a promising candidate material for valleytronics applications. We reveal that Cr$_2$COOH is a ferromagnetic semiconductor and harbors valley features. Due to the simultaneous breaking inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry, the valleys are polarized spontaneously. Moreover, the valley polarization is sizeable in both the valence and conduction bands, benefiting the observation of the anomalous valley Hall effect. More remarkably, the valley splitting can be effectively tuned by the magnetization direction, strain and ferroelectric substrate. More interestingly, the ferroelectric substrate Sc$_2$CO$_2$ can not only regulate the MAE, but also tune valley polarization state. Our findings offer a practical way for realizing highly tunable valleys by multiferroic couplings.|

However, the transition state results obtained at zero Kelvin are often utilized for prediction or interpretation of dynamical processes at high temperatures, and the error bars of such approximation are largely unknown. In this benchmark study, all the major temperature effects including lattice expansion, lattice vibration, electron excitation, and band-edge shift are evaluated with first-principles calculations for defects diffusion in solids. With inclusion of these temperature effects, the notable discrepancies between theoretical predictions at zero Kelvin and the experimental diffusivities at high temperatures are dramatically reduced. Particularly, we find that the lattice expansion and lattice vibration are dominant factors lowering the defect formation energies and hopping barriers at high temperatures, but the electron excitation exhibits minor effects. In sharp contrast to typical assumption, the attempt frequency with lattice expansion and vibration varies significantly with materials: several THz for aluminum bulk but surprisingly over 500 THz for 4H-SiC. For defects in semiconductors, the band-edge shift is also significant at high temperatures and plays a vital role in the defect diffusion. We expect this study would help accurately predict the dynamical processes at high temperatures.|

We conduct a survey across 12 agronomists to understand these networking requirements of farm workloads and perform extensive measurements of WiFi 6 performance in a farm to identify the challenges in meeting them. Our measurements reveal how network capacity is fundamentally limited in such a setting, with severe degradation in network performance due to crop canopy, and spotlight farm networks as an emerging new problem domain that can benefit from smarter network resource management decisions. To that end, we design Cornet, a network for supporting on-farm applications that comprises: (i) a multi-hop mesh of WiFi routers that uses a strategic combination of 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands as informed by our measurements, and (ii) a centralized traffic engineering (TE) system that uses a novel abstraction of resource units to reason about wireless network capacity and make TE decisions (schedule flows, assign flow rates, and select routes and channels). Our evaluation, using testbeds in a farm and trace-driven simulations, shows how Cornet achieves 1.4 $\times$ higher network utilization and better meets application demands, compared to standard wireless mesh strategies.|

Burhonzoda et.al.|[2311.00786v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00786v1)|null|The structural, electronic, optical and elastic properties of perovskites of the $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-phase family CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) are analyzed by ab initio methods using GGA, SCAN and HSE06. It is found that the lattice constants of CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ decrease with decreasing anion size from I to Cl, and when passing from CsSnI$_3$ to CsSnCl$_3$, the band gap width decreases slightly at the beginning and then increases. The optical characteristics were evaluated and it was found that the $\alpha$-, $\beta$-phase of CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ at $x=1$ has a wide absorption range and high absorption coefficients compared to other Cl concentrations. The elastic constants of $\alpha$-CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ perovskite have been calculated and their bulk moduli, shear moduli, sound velocities and Debye temperatures under pressure in the range from 0 to 30 GPa have been considered, with the external pressure induction increasing in steps of 5 GPa. These materials are found to be mechanically stable perovskites according to Born stability criteria and low bulk moduli. Thus, we predict that perovskites of the CsSnI$_{3-x}$Cl$_x$ family are good candidates for optical materials used in solar cells.|

Reynolds et.al.|[2311.00780v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00780v1)|null|The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) is a Probe-class concept that will build on the legacy of the Chandra X-ray Observatory by providing low-background, arcsecond-resolution imaging in the 0.3-10 keV band across a 450 arcminute$^2$ field of view, with an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity. AXIS utilizes breakthroughs in the construction of lightweight segmented X-ray optics using single-crystal silicon, and developments in the fabrication of large-format, small-pixel, high readout rate CCD detectors with good spectral resolution, allowing a robust and cost-effective design. Further, AXIS will be responsive to target-of-opportunity alerts and, with onboard transient detection, will be a powerful facility for studying the time-varying X-ray universe, following on from the legacy of the Neil Gehrels (Swift) X-ray observatory that revolutionized studies of the transient X-ray Universe. In this paper, we present an overview of AXIS, highlighting the prime science objectives driving the AXIS concept and how the observatory design will achieve these objectives.|
