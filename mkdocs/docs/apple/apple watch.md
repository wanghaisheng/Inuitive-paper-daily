|**2024-07-05**|**EAGERx: Graph-Based Framework for Sim2real Robot Learning**|Bas van der Heijden et.al.|[2407.04328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04328v1)|null|Sim2real, that is, the transfer of learned control policies from simulation to real world, is an area of growing interest in robotics due to its potential to efficiently handle complex tasks. The sim2real approach faces challenges due to mismatches between simulation and reality. These discrepancies arise from inaccuracies in modeling physical phenomena and asynchronous control, among other factors. To this end, we introduce EAGERx, a framework with a unified software pipeline for both real and simulated robot learning. It can support various simulators and aids in integrating state, action and time-scale abstractions to facilitate learning. EAGERx's integrated delay simulation, domain randomization features, and proposed synchronization algorithm contribute to narrowing the sim2real gap. We demonstrate (in the context of robot learning and beyond) the efficacy of EAGERx in accommodating diverse robotic systems and maintaining consistent simulation behavior. EAGERx is open source and its code is available at https://eagerx.readthedocs.io.|

The first eigenfunction admits a Fourier--Gegenbauer series expansion via the bispherical coordinates, where the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on $\Gamma_S$ can be recursively expressed in terms of the expansion coefficients arXiv:2309.09587. In this paper, we develop a finite section approach for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator to approximate the first Steklov--Dirichlet eigenvalue on eccentric spherical shells. We prove the exponential convergence of this approach by using the variational characterization of the first eigenvalue. Furthermore, based on the convergence result, we propose a numerical computation scheme as an extension of the two-dimensional result in [Hong et al., Ann. Mat. Pura Appl., 2022] to general dimensions. We provide numerical examples of the first Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalue on eccentric spherical shells with various geometric configurations.|

It is proved that if $k\ge 3$ and $n>k(k+2)$, then the generalized Petersen graph $GP(n,k)$ is not distance-balanced and that $GP(k(k+2),k)$ is distance-balanced. This significantly improves the main result of Yang et al.\ [Electron.\ J.\ Combin.\ 16 (2009) \#N33]. It is also proved that if $k\ge 6$, where $k$ is even, and $n>\frac{5}{4}k^2+2k$, or if $k\ge 5$, where $k$ is odd, and $n>\frac{7}{4}k^2+\frac{3}{4}k$, then $GP(n,k)$ is not $2$-distance-balanced. These results partially resolve a conjecture of Miklavi\v{c} and \v{S}parl [Discrete Appl.\ Math.\ 244 (2018) 143--154].|

The results show that despite radial bar charts are the most popular visualization for activity data on smartwatches, the users' preferences might be influenced by their familiarity with these charts. These findings from this survey will be valuable for designers, developers, and researchers who are interested in creating innovative and effective solutions for activity visualization on smartwatches.|

Prabhu et.al.|[2407.01935v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01935v1)|null|In network theory, the domination parameter is vital in investigating several structural features of the networks, including connectedness, their tendency to form clusters, compactness, and symmetry. In this context, various domination parameters have been created using several properties to determine where machines should be placed to ensure that all the places are monitored. To ensure efficient and effective operation, a piece of equipment must monitor their network (power networks) to answer whenever there is a change in the demand and availability conditions. Consequently, phasor measurement units (PMUs) are utilised by numerous electrical companies to monitor their networks perpetually. Overseeing an electrical system which consists of minimum PMUs is the same as the vertex covering the problem of graph theory, in which a subset D of a vertex set V is a power dominating set (PDS) if it monitors generators, cables, and all other components, in the electrical system using a few guidelines. Hypercube is one of the versatile, most popular, adaptable, and convertible interconnection networks. Its appealing qualities led to the development of other hypercube variants. A fractal cubic network is a new variant of the hypercube that can be used as a best substitute in case faults occur in the hypercube, which was wrongly defined in [Eng. Sci. Technol. 18(1) (2015) 32-41]. Arulperumjothi et al. have recently corrected this definition and redefined this variant with the exact definition in [Appl. Math. Comput. 452 (2023) 128037]. This article determines the PDS of the fractal cubic network. Further, we investigate the resolving power dominating set (RPDS), which contrasts starkly with hypercubes, where resolving power domination is inherently challenging.|

We view the effectiveness of Borel summation as a regularity property of the solution, and we show that the solutions of certain differential equation and integration problems are regular in this sense. By taking a geometric perspective on the Laplace and Borel transforms, we also clarify why "Borel regular" solutions are associated with special points on the Borel plane. The particular classes of problems we look at are level 1 ODEs and exponential period integrals over one dimensional Lefschetz thimbles. To expand the variety of examples available in the literature, we treat various examples of these problems in detail.|

We present a practical jamming attack, namely UWBAD, against commercial UWB ranging systems, which exploits the vulnerability of the adoption of the normalized cross-correlation process in UWB ranging and can selectively and quickly block ranging sessions without prior knowledge of the configurations of the victim devices, potentially leading to severe consequences such as property loss, unauthorized access, or vehicle theft. UWBAD achieves more effective and less imperceptible jamming due to: (i) it efficiently blocks every ranging session by leveraging the field-level jamming, thereby exerting a tangible impact on commercial UWB ranging systems, and (ii) the compact, reactive, and selective system design based on COTS UWB chips, making it affordable and less imperceptible. We successfully conducted real attacks against commercial UWB ranging systems from the three largest UWB chip vendors on the market, e.g., Apple, NXP, and Qorvo. We reported our findings to Apple, related Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), and the Automotive Security Research Group, triggering internal security incident response procedures at Volkswagen, Audi, Bosch, and NXP. As of the writing of this paper, the related OEM has acknowledged this vulnerability in their automotive systems and has offered a $5,000 reward as a bounty.|

It has many applications and relations to other areas of mathematics and sciences. In this paper, we consider this decomposition problem over a field of prime characteristic. We define a classical orthogonal decomposition of a modular Lie algebra and construct it for $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ under certain sufficient conditions. Additionally, we provide more detailed analysis of the problem when $n = 2$ and $3$.|

The GAVRT Solar Patrol project uses a 34 m diameter antenna to produce raster-scan maps of the Sun simultaneously at 4 frequencies ranging from approximately 3 GHz to 14 GHz. On 2024 May 14, as part of regular GAVRT Solar Patrol observations, raster maps were produced when an X8.7 solar flare occurred in active region AR13664. Here we present the GAVRT maps of the May 14 flare along with microwave flux density spectra showing the non-thermal microwave burst emission from mildly relativistic electrons produced in this largest flare of Solar Cycle 25 to date. AR13664 reappeared as AR13697 and continued to be very active, producing X flares while GAVRT monitored its activity. GAVRT microwave data provide a powerful complement to the energetic electrons tracked by X-ray, millimeter-wave and {\gamma}-ray emissions.|

To emulate these in aerial robots weighing less than a gram, known as flying insect robots (FIRs), a fast and responsive control system is essential. To date, these have largely been, at their core, elaborations of proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type feedback control. Without exception, their gains have been painstakingly tuned by hand. Aggressive maneuvers have further required task-specific tuning. Optimal control has the potential to mitigate these issues, but has to date only been demonstrated using approxiate models and receding horizon controllers (RHC) that are too computationally demanding to be carried out onboard the robot. Here we used a more accurate stroke-averaged model of forces and torques to implement the first demonstration of optimal control on an FIR that is computationally efficient enough to be performed by a microprocessor carried onboard. We took force and torque measurements from a 150 mg FIR, the UW Robofly, using a custom-built sensitive force-torque sensor, and validated them using motion capture data in free flight. We demonstrated stable hovering (RMS error of about 4 cm) and trajectory tracking maneuvers at translational velocities up to 25 cm/s using an optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR). These results were enabled by a more accurate model and lay the foundation for future work that uses our improved model and optimal controller in conjunction with recent advances in low-power receding horizon control to perform accurate aggressive maneuvers without iterative, task-specific tuning.|

These API-based agents, leveraging the strong autonomy and planning capabilities of LLMs, can efficiently solve problems requiring multi-step actions. However, their ability to handle multi-dimensional difficulty levels, diverse task types, and real-world demands through APIs remains unknown. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{ShortcutsBench}, a large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of API-based agents in solving tasks with varying levels of difficulty, diverse task types, and real-world demands. \textsc{ShortcutsBench} includes a wealth of real APIs from Apple Inc.'s operating systems, refined user queries from shortcuts, human-annotated high-quality action sequences from shortcut developers, and accurate parameter filling values about primitive parameter types, enum parameter types, outputs from previous actions, and parameters that need to request necessary information from the system or user. Our extensive evaluation of agents built with $5$ leading open-source (size >= 57B) and $4$ closed-source LLMs (e.g. Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-3.5) reveals significant limitations in handling complex queries related to API selection, parameter filling, and requesting necessary information from systems and users. These findings highlight the challenges that API-based agents face in effectively fulfilling real and complex user queries. All datasets, code, and experimental results will be available at \url{https://github.com/eachsheep/shortcutsbench}.|

Unlike commercial health apps for wearables, our system offers a comprehensive statistical analysis component that discovers correlations and trends in user data, allowing users to ask questions in natural language and receive generated personalized insights, and guides them to develop actionable goals. As a case study, we focus on improving sleep quality, given its measurability through physiological data and its importance to general well-being. Through a user study with 24 Fitbit watch users, we demonstrate that PhysioLLM outperforms both the Fitbit App alone and a generic LLM chatbot in facilitating a deeper, personalized understanding of health data and supporting actionable steps toward personal health goals.|

Major processor vendors now offer heterogeneous architectures that combine powerful cores with energy-efficient ones, such as Intel P/E systems, Apple M1 chips, and Samsungs Exyno's CPUs. However, apart from simple cost-based thread allocation strategies, today's OS schedulers do not fully exploit these systems' potential for adaptive energy-efficient computing. This is, in part, due to missing application-level interfaces to pass information about task-level energy consumption and application-level elasticity. This paper presents E-Mapper, a novel resource management approach integrated into Linux for improved execution on heterogeneous processors. In E-Mapper, we base resource allocation decisions on high-level application descriptions that user can attach to programs or that the system can learn automatically at runtime. Our approach supports various programming models including OpenMP, Intel TBB, and TensorFlow. Crucially, E-Mapper leverages this information to extend beyond existing thread-to-core allocation strategies by actively managing application configurations through a novel uniform application-resource manager interface. By doing so, E-Mapper achieves substantial enhancements in both performance and energy efficiency, particularly in multi-application scenarios. On an Intel Raptor Lake and an Arm big.LITTLE system, E-Mapper reduces the application execution on average by 20 % with an average reduction in energy consumption of 34 %. We argue that our solution marks a crucial step toward creating a generic approach for sustainable and efficient computing across different processor architectures.|

For an $R$-module $M$ there is an isomorphism $\Gamma(U, \tilde{M}) \cong \varinjlim \operatorname{Hom}_R(J^n,M)$ known as Deligne's formula (see [R. Hartshorne: Algebraic Geometry, Springer, 1983] and Deligne's Appendix in [R. Hartshorne: Residues and Duality, Lecture Notes in Math. 20, Springer,1966] ). We extend the isomorphism for any $R$-module $M$ in the non-Noetherian case of $R$ and $J = (x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ a certain finitely generated ideal. Moreover, we recall a corresponding sheaf construction.|

However, there is a lack of research focused on predicting and developing application systems using clinical notes and blood test values. We collected five years of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from Taiwan's hospital database between 2017 and 2021 as an AI database. Furthermore, we developed an EHR-based chronic disease prediction platform utilizing Large Language Multimodal Models (LLMMs), successfully integrating with frontend web and mobile applications for prediction. This prediction platform can also connect to the hospital's backend database, providing physicians with real-time risk assessment diagnostics.

However, previous attempts still struggle with stochastic inference, conflicting with the deterministic nature of the Image2Normal task, and costly ensembling step, which slows down the estimation process. Our method, StableNormal, mitigates the stochasticity of the diffusion process by reducing inference variance, thus producing "Stable-and-Sharp" normal estimates without any additional ensembling process. StableNormal works robustly under challenging imaging conditions, such as extreme lighting, blurring, and low quality. It is also robust against transparent and reflective surfaces, as well as cluttered scenes with numerous objects. Specifically, StableNormal employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, which starts with a one-step normal estimator (YOSO) to derive an initial normal guess, that is relatively coarse but reliable, then followed by a semantic-guided refinement process (SG-DRN) that refines the normals to recover geometric details. The effectiveness of StableNormal is demonstrated through competitive performance in standard datasets such as DIODE-indoor, iBims, ScannetV2 and NYUv2, and also in various downstream tasks, such as surface reconstruction and normal enhancement. These results evidence that StableNormal retains both the "stability" and "sharpness" for accurate normal estimation. StableNormal represents a baby attempt to repurpose diffusion priors for deterministic estimation. To democratize this, code and models have been publicly available in hf.co/Stable-X|

Unfortunately, many children and youth from low-income families are unable to engage in this sport mainly due to financial constraints such as private lesson expenses as well as logistical concerns to and back from such lessons and clinics. While several tennis self-training systems exist, they are often tailored for professionals and are prohibitively expensive. The present study aims to classify tennis players' skill levels and classify tennis strokes into phases characterized by motion attributes for a future development of an AI-based tennis self-training model for affordable and convenient applications running on devices used in daily life such as an iPhone or an Apple Watch for tennis skill improvement. We collected motion data, including Motion Yaw, Roll and Pitch from inertial measurement units (IMUs) worn by participating junior tennis players. For this pilot study, data from twelve participants were processed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The SVM models demonstrated an overall accuracy of 77% in classifying players as beginners or intermediates, with low rates of false positives and false negatives, effectively distinguishing skill levels. Additionally, the tennis swings were successfully classified into five phases based on the collected motion data. These findings indicate that SVM-based classification can be a reliable foundation for developing an equitable and accessible AI-driven tennis training system.|

Mironov et.al.|[2406.16014v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16014v1)|null|We show that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the paramagnetic response of itinerant electrons in proximitized superconductor/paramagnet systems gives rise to the inverse spin galvanic effect, i.e. generation of magnetic moment under the influence of the charge current. Depending on the sign of the SOC constant and the system temperature, the corresponding contribution to the magnetic response of the superconductor can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic. We discuss the relevance between the discovered phenomena and the recent experiments on Pt/Nb heterostructures as well as the puzzling sign change of the magnetic response observed in clean Ag coated Nb cylinders.|

Unlike the former mechanism, which involves phonons with finite momentum, the latter can be exclusively attributed to {\it coherent phonons} with zero momentum. We here lay down the microscopic theory of coherent phonons interacting with resonantly pumped bright excitons and provide the explicit expression of the corresponding coupling. The coupling notably resembles the exciton-phonon one, but with a crucial distinction: it contains the bare electron-phonon matrix elements rather than the screened ones. Our theory predicts that the exciton energy features a polaronic-like red-shift and monochromatic oscillations or beatings, depending on the number of coupled optical modes. Both the red-shift and the amplitude of the oscillations are proportional to the excitation density and to the square of the exciton-coherent-phonon coupling. We validate our analytical findings through comparisons with numerical simulations of time-resolved optical absorbance in resonantly pumped MoS$_{2}$ monolayers.|

Two types of boundary conditions are identified; one in which the radial velocity along the axis is prescribed, and the other in which the radial velocity along the axis is obtained as an eigenvalue of the problem. The existence of these solutions are limited to a range of Reynolds numbers and the transition from one case to the other are discussed in detail.|

The new vortex solutions generalize the classical Burgers' vortex and Sullivan's vortex solutions in the presence of a volumetric line source at the symmetry axis, the former approaching the Burgers' vortex sheet when the source strength becomes very large. The stability of the generalized Burgers' vortex is studied. In a different manner from the classical solution, the generalized Burgers' vortices are found to be unstable for two-dimensional disturbances when the vortex Reynolds number is increased above a critical value, for a fixed strength of the volumetric source.|

The occurrence of ICR originates from the ion enrichment and depletion in conical pores, whose formation is found to be affected by the scanning rate of voltages. Here, through time-dependent simulations, we investigate the variation of ion current under electric fields and the dynamic formation of ion enrichment and depletion, which can reflect the response time of conical nanopores. The response time of nanopores when ion enrichment forms i.e. at the on state is significantly longer than that with the formation of ion depletion i.e. at the off state. Our simulation results reveal the regulation of response time by different nanopore parameters including the surface charge density, pore length, tip, and base radius, as well as the applied conditions such as the voltage and bulk concentration. The response time of nanopores is closely related to the surface charge density, pore length, voltage, and bulk concentration. Our uncovered dynamic response mechanism of the ionic current can guide the design of nanofluidic devices with conical nanopores, including memristors, ionic switches, and rectifiers.|

Chien et.al.|[2406.14888v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14888v1)|null|The nature of the interaction between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their host galaxies remains an unsolved question. Therefore, conducting an AGN census is valuable to AGN research. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of AGNs are obscured by their environment, which blocks UV and optical emissions due to the dusty torus surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). To overcome this challenge, mid-infrared (IR) surveys have emerged as a valuable tool for identifying obscured AGNs, as the obscured light is re-emitted in this range. With its high sensitivity, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) uncovered more fainter objects than previous telescopes. By applying the SED fitting, this work investigates AGN candidates in JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) fields. We identified 42 candidates, 30 of them are classified as composites ($0.2\leq f_{\rm AGN, IR}< 0.5$), and 12 of them are AGNs ($f_{\rm AGN, IR}\geq 0.5$). We report the AGN luminosity contributions and AGN number fractions as a function of redshift and total infrared luminosity, showing that previously reported increasing relations are not apparent in our sample due to the sample size. We also extend the previous results on ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, $L_{\rm TIR}\geq 10^{12} L_{\odot}$) to less luminous AGNs, highlighting the power of JWST.|

Valenzuela et.al.|[2406.14691v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14691v1)|null|Gravimeters fabricated with MEMS suffer from temperature-dependent drifts in their long-term stability. We analyze the thermal contributions to the signal, and we propose three mechanisms to mitigate their effects. The first one uses materials that fulfill the condition $\alpha_E=-2 \alpha$, where the thermal expansion is canceled by the temperature variation of the Young's modulus. The second one uses the thermal expansion to introduce a compression that compensates the variation in the force of the spring. In the third one, the expansion compensates the displacement of the proof mass in the sensor, rather than the force. The three mechanisms are robust since they only depend on the temperature of the sensor itself.|

We operationalize sites of multimodal integration as regions where a multimodal vision-language model predicts recordings better than unimodal language, unimodal vision, or linearly-integrated language-vision models. Our target DNN models span different architectures (e.g., convolutional networks and transformers) and multimodal training techniques (e.g., cross-attention and contrastive learning). As a key enabling step, we first demonstrate that trained vision and language models systematically outperform their randomly initialized counterparts in their ability to predict SEEG signals. We then compare unimodal and multimodal models against one another. Because our target DNN models often have different architectures, number of parameters, and training sets (possibly obscuring those differences attributable to integration), we carry out a controlled comparison of two models (SLIP and SimCLR), which keep all of these attributes the same aside from input modality. Using this approach, we identify a sizable number of neural sites (on average 141 out of 1090 total sites or 12.94%) and brain regions where multimodal integration seems to occur. Additionally, we find that among the variants of multimodal training techniques we assess, CLIP-style training is the best suited for downstream prediction of the neural activity in these sites.|

In the absence of clear legal definitions and a lack of transparency regarding the role of algorithms in shaping decisions on content moderation, there is a critical need for external accountability. Our study contributes to filling this gap by systematically evaluating four leading cloud-based content moderation services through a third-party audit, highlighting issues such as biases against minorities and vulnerable groups that may arise through over-reliance on these services. Using a black-box audit approach and four benchmark data sets, we measure performance in explicit and implicit hate speech detection as well as counterfactual fairness through perturbation sensitivity analysis and present disparities in performance for certain target identity groups and data sets. Our analysis reveals that all services had difficulties detecting implicit hate speech, which relies on more subtle and codified messages. Moreover, our results point to the need to remove group-specific bias. It seems that biases towards some groups, such as Women, have been mostly rectified, while biases towards other groups, such as LGBTQ+ and PoC remain.|

However, due to the lack of rich events in the videos, these datasets may suffer from the short-cut bias that the answers can be deduced from a few frames, without the need to watch the entire video. To address this issue, we introduce Event-Bench, an event-oriented long video understanding benchmark built on existing datasets and human annotations. Event-Bench includes six event-related tasks and 2,190 test instances to comprehensively evaluate video event understanding ability. Additionally, we propose Video Instruction Merging~(VIM), a cost-effective method that enhances video MLLMs using merged, event-intensive video instructions, addressing the scarcity of human-annotated, event-intensive data. Extensive experiments show that the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 53.33, significantly outperforming the best open-source model by 41.42%. Leveraging an effective instruction synthesis method and an adaptive model architecture, VIM surpasses both state-of-the-art open-source models and GPT-4V on the Event-Bench. All code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Event-Bench.|

Shapiro et.al.|[2406.13572v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13572v1)|null|High-rate, high-fidelity entanglement distribution is essential to the creation of a quantum internet, but recent achievements in fiber and satellite-based entanglement distribution fall far short of what is needed. Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 054209 (2023)] proposed a means for dramatically increasing entanglement-distribution rates via zero added-loss multiplexing (ZALM). ZALM's quantum transmitter employs a pair of Sagnac-configured spontaneous parametric downconverters (SPDCs), channelization via dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, and partial Bell-state measurements (BSMs) to realize a near-deterministic, heralded source of frequency-multiplexed polarization-entangled biphotons. Each biphoton is transmitted to Alice and Bob with a classical message identifying its frequency channel and the heralded entangled state. Their quantum receivers use DWDM filtering and mode conversion to interface their received biphotons to intra-cavity color-center quantum memories. This paper delves deeply into ZALM's SPDCs, partial-BSMs, and loading of Alice and Bob's quantum memories. It derives the density operators for the SPDC sources and the quantum memories, allowing heralding probability, heralding efficiency, and fidelity to be evaluated for both the polarization-entangled biphotons and the loaded quantum memories, thus enabling exploration of the parameter space for optimizing ZALM performance. Even without optimization analysis, the paper already demonstrates two critical features of the ZALM architecture: the necessity of achieving a near-separable channelized biphoton wave function to ensure the biphoton sent to Alice and Bob is of high purity; and the premium placed on Alice and Bob's temporal-mode converters' enabling narrowband push-pull memory loading to ensure the arriving biphoton's state is faithfully transferred to the intra-cavity color centers.|

Nevertheless, existing MoE methods usually enforce a constant top-k routing for all tokens, which is arguably restrictive because various tokens (e.g., "<EOS>" vs. "apple") may require various numbers of experts for feature abstraction. Lifting such a constraint can help make the most of limited resources and unleash the potential of the model for downstream tasks. In this sense, we introduce AdaMoE to realize token-adaptive routing for MoE, where different tokens are permitted to select a various number of experts. AdaMoE makes minimal modifications to the vanilla MoE with top-k routing -- it simply introduces a fixed number of null experts, which do not consume any FLOPs, to the expert set and increases the value of k. AdaMoE does not force each token to occupy a fixed number of null experts but ensures the average usage of the null experts with a load-balancing loss, leading to an adaptive number of null/true experts used by each token. AdaMoE exhibits a strong resemblance to MoEs with expert choice routing while allowing for trivial auto-regressive modeling. AdaMoE is easy to implement and can be effectively applied to pre-trained (MoE-)LLMs. Extensive studies show that AdaMoE can reduce average expert load (FLOPs) while achieving superior performance. For example, on the ARC-C dataset, applying our method to fine-tuning Mixtral-8x7B can reduce FLOPs by 14.5% while increasing accuracy by 1.69%.|
